## Phala Network: The Execution Layer for Web3 AI
Phala Network brings confidential, verifiable AI to Web3 by running off-chain agent logic inside hardware-secured enclaves and anchoring proofs on a Polkadot parachain. This guide explains how Phala works, what **Phat Contracts** and **AI-Agent Contracts** enable, where TEEs fit alongside zkML/oracles, and how to ship a small agent in practice—plus pitfalls, FAQs, and SEO-ready resources.

## Why this matters (problem/benefit)
Blockchains are great at consensus, not at private, heavy, or API-driven compute. Most AI agents today run off-chain with opaque logic and exposed API keys. Phala Network closes that gap: developers publish agent logic on a Polkadot parachain; execution happens inside **trusted execution environments (TEEs)**, producing proofs that are verified on-chain. You get **private inputs**, **tamper-resistant execution**, and **on-chain-verifiable outcomes**, with cross-chain reach through Polkadot.

## ELI5
Think of Phala as a **locked computer room** that runs your AI code. Only your program can see the data inside; even the system admin can’t peek. The room hands back a stamped receipt (attestation) proving what ran. The blockchain stores the receipts and coordinates many such rooms. That’s how you call models and APIs privately while keeping Web3-grade auditability.

## How Phala Network works
### Architecture: TEE + parachain
* **TEE layer (off-chain):** Phala uses Intel SGX to run agent logic inside secure enclaves (pRuntime). SGX isolates code and data so even privileged processes can’t read them. The enclave produces **remote attestations**—proofs of correct execution.
* **Parachain layer (on-chain):** Phala is a Polkadot **parachain**, inheriting shared security and cross-chain connectivity. Attestations are verified on-chain; contracts and scheduling live on the parachain; results can be forwarded to other chains via Polkadot’s interoperability.
* **Gatekeepers & workers:** **Gatekeeper** nodes manage encryption keys; **workers** (compute providers) run enclaves. Gatekeepers also run pRuntime inside SGX and require stricter hardware confidence levels.
* **Execution flow (simplified):**
  1. Publish contract/agent.
  2. Enclave fetches code and verifies it.
  3. Enclave executes logic, talks to models/APIs if needed, and signs a proof.
  4. The parachain verifies the proof and records the result; hooks can trigger cross-chain updates.

### Phat Contracts & AI-Agent Contracts
* **Phat Contract** is Phala’s off-chain, TEE-backed “smart contract”: event-driven tasks, secure secret storage (API keys), API/model calls, and cross-chain writes. It emits cluster-internal events you consume with the JS SDK for automation.
* **AI-Agent Contract** packages model-centric behaviors (tools, memory, triggers) so teams can create, own, and monetize AI agents that interoperate with on-chain apps.
* **For compute providers:** tooling like a **budget balancer** tunes reward flows across Phala/Khala networks under Phala’s tokenomics.

## Key features
* **Confidential compute by default:** Inputs (secrets, user data) stay sealed inside SGX during execution; proofs (attestations) bind results to the measured code.
* **On-chain verifiability:** Attestations are checked on the parachain, making off-chain AI work auditable and programmable from contracts.
* **Polkadot-native interoperability:** Being a parachain lets Phala route results, messages, and asset actions to other chains without custom bridges.
* **Agent tooling ecosystem:** docs, CLI/JS SDK, and emerging integrations (e.g., GPU TEE inference and agent frameworks) target practical AI agent deployments.

| Layer / tool                |         Private inputs |                           Verifiable execution |     Latency |                    Cost | Developer effort | Typical use cases                                               |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------: | ---------------------------------------------: | ----------: | ----------------------: | ---------------: | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Phala (TEE + parachain)** |          **Yes (SGX)** | **Yes (remote attestation verified on-chain)** |  Low-to-mid |              Low-to-mid |         Moderate | Agents with secrets, API/model calls, cross-chain automation    |
| **zkML (proof-of-ML)**      | Yes (proof hides data) |                 **Strong cryptographic proof** | Mid-to-high | Mid-to-high (proof gen) |             High | Verifiable inference where trust-minimization outweighs latency |
| **Oracle/API middleware**   |               Optional |                            Weak (trust oracle) |     **Low** |                 **Low** |          **Low** | Fast reads/writes without privacy or strong verification        |

*Notes:* The table is directional; exact SLOs depend on model size, proof systems, and network conditions. Phala emphasizes SGX-secured privacy + on-chain attestation; zkML emphasizes pure cryptographic verifiability; oracle routes optimize simplicity/latency without privacy.

## Mini-guide: build & ship a simple AI agent
**Goal:** A Phat/AI-Agent Contract that watches an on-chain event, calls an LLM with a secret key, and writes a summarized outcome back to a target chain.

1. **Model your trigger & state**
   * Define the **event source** (e.g., a Substrate/ink! event or an EVM log).
   * Define **state** you need to keep (windowed lists, last processed block, throttling flags).

2. **Scaffold the project**
   * Scaffold a **Phat Contract** / **AI-Agent Contract** and enable the **JS SDK** for event capture and job dispatch.

3. **Secrets & I/O**
   * Store your **LLM API key** in enclave-protected storage.
   * Implement a call handler that formats prompts, retries on rate-limits, and guards tokens (max context).
   * For deterministic post-processing, normalize outputs (JSON schema, strict parsing).

4. **Attestation & verification path**
   * Ensure your runtime calls produce attestations and are verified by the parachain before you emit follow-up transactions.

5. **Cross-chain write-back**
   * Use cross-chain hooks to post results (e.g., a summary hash or score) to a target chain/app; Polkadot interoperability supports many parachains.

6. **Local testing**
   * Run locally; simulate events; capture cluster events with the JS SDK; validate that your agent handles timeouts, duplicate events, and empty responses.

7. **Ship & monitor**
   * Deploy to the network; add basic observability (structured logs, health checks); set SLOs for freshness and failure budgets.

**Practical example:**
A “Governance Analyst” agent watches **OpenGov** referendum submissions, fetches proposal text/attachments, calls an LLM to summarize risk vectors, then writes a **score + reason** back to a DAO dashboard (and optionally to an on-chain record). Secrets (API keys, preliminary data) never leave the enclave; the chain verifies that the approved agent code produced the result.

## Common pitfalls & pro tips
* **Treat LLM output as untrusted:** validate with JSON schemas; add rule-based sanity checks; never let free-text directly authorize on-chain actions.
* **Handle non-determinism:** keep prompts short and tool-driven; use few-shot exemplars; normalize outputs before signing.
* **Secret management ≠ endpoint security:** TEEs protect keys in-use; still rotate keys and limit scopes.
* **Provisioning compute:** if you’re running **workers**, confirm SGX support and BIOS settings; Gatekeepers need higher SGX confidence.
* **Budgeting / rewards:** if you also provide compute, review tokenomics tooling (e.g., a budget balancer) for Phala/Khala balancing.
* **Choose the right tool:** for strict cryptographic verifiability of model math (no TEE trust), zkML may be preferable; for fast, private API/model calls with on-chain checks, Phala fits well.

## FAQs
**1) What exactly is a Phat Contract?**
A Phat Contract is Phala’s TEE-backed off-chain program that can hold secrets, call external APIs/models, react to chain events, and write back on-chain. It emits cluster events consumable via the JS SDK.

**2) How is execution verified if it’s off-chain?**
The enclave produces **remote attestations** binding code identity and outputs; Phala verifies them on its parachain so other contracts can trust the results.

**3) What hardware underpins confidentiality?**
Intel SGX. Code/data run inside SGX-protected enclaves (pRuntime). Even privileged OS processes can’t snoop.

**4) Can Phala agents interact with other chains and dapps?**
Yes. As a Polkadot **parachain**, Phala benefits from native cross-chain messaging and integrations across the ecosystem.

**5) What’s the difference between AI-Agent Contracts and Phat Contracts?**
AI-Agent Contracts are opinionated packages for model-centric behaviors (tools, memory, monetization). Phat Contracts are the general TEE compute runtime they build on.

**6) Do I need SGX hardware to build?**
No. Developers can build and test locally; **compute providers** need SGX when operating workers/gatekeepers on mainnet.

**7) How does this compare to just using an oracle?**
Oracles are simpler but don’t provide strong privacy guarantees for inputs or verifiable execution receipts; Phala focuses on both.

**8) Is there momentum around AI agents/tooling?**
Yes—Phala’s materials outline agent tooling such as GPU TEE inference and builder kits as part of a broader confidential-AI roadmap.

## Conclusion
If you’re shipping AI features that need **private inputs**, **provable execution**, and **multi-chain reach**, Phala Network is purpose-built for that job. Start with a small event-driven agent, wire up secrets and attestations, then iterate toward richer toolchains and cross-chain automation.
