## NeuroWeb on Polkadot: A Practical Guide to Knowledge Mining, DKG & NEURO Utility

NeuroWeb is a decentralized AI blockchain in the Polkadot ecosystem that turns high-quality, provenance-rich data into an on-chain asset class via **Knowledge Mining**. This guide explains how NeuroWeb works with the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG), why Polkadot matters, and how teams can publish Knowledge Assets and participate in the NEURO-powered knowledge economy.

## Why NeuroWeb exists (and who it’s for)
Modern AI needs **trustworthy, connected knowledge**: sources with provenance, verifiability, and cross-chain discoverability. NeuroWeb solves this by aligning incentives around **Knowledge Assets** (machine-readable, ownable containers of knowledge) and rewarding their creation, curation, and connectivity with the **NEURO** token. Teams that benefit most include AI agents/infra projects, data publishers, archivists, research groups, and application builders who need traceable inputs for models and agentic systems.

## Quick ELI5
Think of NeuroWeb as a **library for AI** where every book (a *Knowledge Asset*) has a tamper-evident card that proves where it came from, what it contains, and how it links to other books. Librarians (*knowledge miners*) earn NEURO for adding trustworthy books and cross-references to the shelves. The library is plugged into **Polkadot**, so it’s secure and can interoperate with many other chains and apps.

## How NeuroWeb fits into Polkadot
NeuroWeb (formerly the **OriginTrail Parachain**) operates as a **parachain** secured by Polkadot’s relay chain. Through Polkadot’s shared security and **XCM** messaging, NeuroWeb can move assets/instructions to other parachains and EVM environments—useful for cross-chain AI/agent workflows and settlement.

**Why this matters**

* **Security & scale:** benefits from Polkadot validator security and block production.
* **Interoperability:** **XCM** for native, trust-minimized transfers to other parachains; **EVM** compatibility for developer reach.

## Core concepts & components
### 1) Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG)
A cross-chain knowledge layer where **Knowledge Assets** live. Assets carry **provenance**, **connectivity** (links), and **discoverability**—all critical for AI agents and RAG systems to trust inputs.

### 2) Knowledge Assets
Ownable containers for facts, documents, models, proofs, or metadata, addressable and linkable across chains. They are the unit that miners create, enrich, and connect.

### 3) Knowledge Mining
The incentive mechanism: publish and connect valuable Knowledge Assets; earn **NEURO** for relevant contributions to the DKG over time.

### 4) NEURO token
Utility token that fuels the knowledge economy—used to reward knowledge creation/curation and to align positive behavior (veracity, relevance, connectivity).

### 5) EVM & Bridging
NeuroWeb is **EVM-enabled**, expanding dev tooling and composability; **XCM** connects to other Polkadot parachains (e.g., moving NEURO to Moonbeam for EVM dapps).

### 6) Networks & ops
* **Mainnet:** secured by the Polkadot relay chain.
* **Testnet:** secured by Rococo, recommended for development.

## How Knowledge Mining works
At a high level, mining follows a **produce → prove → connect → claim** loop:

1. **Produce** — gather/structure data into a Knowledge Asset with metadata, schema, and links.
2. **Prove** — attach verifiability (hashes, signatures, provenance) so consumers can trust it.
3. **Connect** — link to related assets to improve discoverability and graph value.
4. **Claim** — submit on-chain claims/rewards for contributions, paid in NEURO as the graph derives measurable utility.

**Tooling:** A **Knowledge Mining Kit** streamlines asset creation, JSON-LD structuring, and publication to the DKG/NeuroWeb chain.

**Why it’s powerful:** By combining symbolic (knowledge graphs) and neural AI, organizations can build **verifiable AI**—not just outputs, but their **inputs** are auditable and traceable (key for IP protection, deepfake defense, safety, and compliance).

## Step-by-step: publish your first Knowledge Asset
1. **Model your data**
   Define your subject, predicates, and relationships; choose a schema (JSON-LD recommended) and list the external references you’ll cite.

2. **Create the asset**
   Use the **Knowledge Mining Kit** to package content + metadata into a Knowledge Asset. Include provenance (source identifiers, timestamps, signatures).

3. **Publish to DKG/NeuroWeb**
   Submit the asset to DKG and register on NeuroWeb. Ensure your node/wallet is funded for fees in the target environment (testnet vs mainnet).

4. **Connect it**
   Link to related Knowledge Assets to maximize relevance and graph value (think citations/cross-refs).

5. **Claim mining rewards**
   File claims for **Knowledge Mining**; track eligibility windows and contribution proofs. Reward parameters and program phases may evolve.

6. **Bridge for composability (optional)**
   If your app lives on an EVM chain like Moonbeam, bridge **NEURO** or interact via XCM to compose with EVM dapps/agents.

## Common pitfalls & pro tips
### Pitfalls
* **Weak provenance** → missing hashes, unclear source attributions.
* **Poor linkage** → isolated assets don’t earn relevance; connect them.
* **Ignoring schema** → unstructured blobs reduce discoverability for agents.
* **Publishing private data** → treat sensitive content carefully; follow legal/ethical norms.
* **Skipping testnet** → deploy to a **Rococo-secured testnet** first to catch issues.

### Pro tips
* **Use JSON-LD + consistent vocabularies** to maximize machine readability.
* **Plan cross-chain UX** early—if your consumers live on EVM, design flows with XCM and parachain endpoints from day one.
* **Measure graph impact**—track how your assets are referenced/queried; iterate to increase connectivity.
* **Stay aligned with roadmap**—reward parameters and program phases may update over time.

## FAQs
**1) Is NeuroWeb a standalone L1 or a Polkadot parachain?**
It’s a **parachain** secured by Polkadot’s relay chain, with EVM support.

**2) What exactly is “Knowledge Mining”?**
A process/incentive mechanism to publish, verify, and connect **Knowledge Assets**, rewarding contributors with **NEURO**.

**3) What did NeuroWeb used to be?**
It was previously the **OriginTrail Parachain**; the transformation into NeuroWeb followed a community governance vote.

**4) How does bridging work?**
NeuroWeb uses **XCM** for native transfers across the Polkadot ecosystem (e.g., to Moonbeam for EVM).

**5) What’s the NEURO token used for?**
To incentivize knowledge creation, connectivity, and sharing within the DKG/NeuroWeb economy.

**6) Where do I test integrations?**
Use the **NeuroWeb Testnet** (Rococo-secured) for development; deploy to mainnet after validation.

**7) Can AI agents read from/write to the DKG?**
Yes—tooling and EVM support make it practical to integrate agents that consume and publish Knowledge Assets.

**8) What are typical use cases?**
Verifiable data pipelines for RAG/agents, IP provenance and authenticity, safety/deepfake defense, and cross-industry data sharing.

## Conclusion
NeuroWeb gives builders and AI teams a **verifiable knowledge substrate** that’s natively incentivized and **interoperable** across Polkadot and EVM. If your agents or models depend on trustworthy, traceable inputs, start mining and linking **Knowledge Assets**—and plug your app into the NEURO-powered knowledge economy today.
