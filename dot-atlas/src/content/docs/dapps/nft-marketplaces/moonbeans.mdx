Operating on the MoonRiver and MoonBeam networks, and soon to launch on Arbitrum Nova, MoonBeans offers unmatched marketplace rewards, community governance via a DAO, and customizable storefronts. Letâ€™s dive into the details of what makes MoonBeans an essential part of the Polkadot ecosystem.

## What is MoonBeans NFT Marketplace?
MoonBeans ($BEANS) is the first token on the MoonRiver and MoonBeam networks that rewards holders simply for holding the tokens. The platform comprises three main components:
1. **Marketplace Rewards**: Users earn rewards from ecosystem trading volume by holding BEANS, SEEDS, or BEANIES.
2. **Community DAO**: Smart contract decisions are governed by the $BEANS community via a fully functional DAO.
3. **Customized Storefronts**: Supports NFT projects with special needs, offering custom storefronts and item pages.
