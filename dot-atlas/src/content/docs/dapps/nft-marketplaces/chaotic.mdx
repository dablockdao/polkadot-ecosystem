Chaotic is a new marketplace for non fungible tokens in the Polkadot ecosystem. The project is introduced by members of the team known for work on Koda and is presented as a continuation of that experience with updated ownership and a lighter code base. The stated focus includes creator experience, faster performance, and community facing campaigns that encourage participation beyond listing and trading.

## Team and origins
Koda served as a visible venue for artists and collectors within the broader Polkadot family. Chaotic positions itself as the next step by the same core builders, which provides continuity for creators who published on Koda and for users familiar with its workflows and curation style.

## Migration and continuity
The announcement indicates that collections supported on Koda will transition to Chaotic while preserving access and ownership for current holders. For creators and collectors, the intention is a seamless handover. The team also mentions incentives for early participants to support initial liquidity and engagement.

## Asset Hub support
Asset Hub functions as a system parachain for creating and transferring assets including NFTs. Chaotic lists improved Asset Hub support as part of its roadmap, aligning the marketplace with common minting and transfer practices in the Polkadot ecosystem.

## PolkaVM and Ethereum style tooling
Chaotic references interest in PolkaVM to reach developers who rely on Solidity and familiar Ethereum tools. PolkaVM aims for high Ethereum compatibility while adopting choices suited to Polkadot. As the environment matures, this direction may reduce integration friction for teams that want contract portability and standard developer tooling.

## Initial focus for stakeholders
• **Creators**
Review publishing flows, royalty options, metadata handling, and discoverability in search and category pages.
• **Collectors**
Confirm wallet connectivity, portfolio continuity, and provenance details for migrated collections.
• **Developers**
Track documentation on Asset Hub features and PolkaVM guidance before planning integrations that depend on specific contract behavior.

## Conclusion
Chaotic introduces a marketplace that builds on Koda experience while aligning with Asset Hub and exploring PolkaVM for broader developer reach. The impact on the Polkadot NFT economy will depend on the quality of the collection migration, clarity of creator onboarding, and delivery of the stated product improvements.
