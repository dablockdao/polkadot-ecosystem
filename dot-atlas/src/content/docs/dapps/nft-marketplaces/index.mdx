## Polkadot NFT Marketplaces (2025): The Practical Guide for Artists, Builders, and Power Users
An up-to-date guide to **Polkadot NFT marketplaces**—what’s live, what’s new (e.g., **Chaotic**), and how to choose the right venue across Asset Hub, Unique, Moonbeam/Moonriver, Astar... Includes comparisons, workflows, pitfalls, and FAQs.

## ELI5: How Polkadot NFT marketplaces differ
* **Many chains, one ecosystem.** On Polkadot, NFTs can live on **Asset Hub** (system parachain) or on **application parachains** (e.g., Unique, Moonbeam, Astar).
* **Different standards.**

  * **RMRK** via **Singular**: modular “NFT 2.0” features like **nesting** and **equippables**.
  * **Unique Network**: chain-level features such as **nesting/bundling**, SDKs, and a native wallet.
  * **EVM chains** (Moonbeam/Moonriver, Astar EVM): familiar ERC-721/1155 UX with MetaMask-style wallets.
  * **Ink!/PSP** (Astar WASM): marketplaces like **ArtZero** using PSP34/PSP37 standards.

## What’s new in 2025 (quick hits)
* **Chaotic** launched **public beta (late August 2025)** as a fresh Polkadot-native marketplace from the Koda-aligned team. Early drops, including “Octopus,” sold out quickly.
* **Unique Network** emphasized marketplace and wallet polish, plus NFT-centric cross-chain messaging concepts; creator tutorials have been refreshed.

## How to pick: decision checklist
* **Where do your users already hold assets?**
  * **EVM wallets (MetaMask):** Moonbeam/Moonriver → **MoonBeans**, **Raresama**.
  * **Polkadot extension wallets & Asset Hub:** **Chaotic**, **Singular**, **Unique**.
* **What features do you need?**
  * **Game-ready composability (nested, equippables):** **Singular (RMRK)** or **Unique**.
  * **WASM/Ink! stack:** **ArtZero** on Astar.
* **Curation vs open listing?** If you want **curation & social proof**, consider **Raresama** or featured drops on **Chaotic**.
* **Keep docs fresh.** Remove **tofuNFT** references; it sunsetted in 2025.

## Mini-guide: list your first NFT on Polkadot (step-by-step)
### A) Asset Hub route (Chaotic / Koda)
1. **Prepare media & metadata** (IPFS pinning, license, attributes).
2. **Connect Polkadot wallet** on **Chaotic** beta.
3. **Mint or import** your NFT/collection; confirm fees on **Asset Hub (DOT)**.
4. **List** with clear supply/price; add collection description and traits.
5. **Promote** the asset via social channels and on-chain references.

### B) Unique route (Unique Marketplace)
1. **Fund Unique Wallet** with the native token.
2. **Create collection** → set attributes, image, royalties.
3. **Mint tokens**, then **Sell Tokens** from the marketplace tab.
4. **Enhance trust signals** with complete metadata and links.

## Common pitfalls & pro tips
* **Wallet mismatch:** Polkadot extension vs MetaMask is the #1 source of failed listings; verify wallet expectations first.
* **Outdated links:** Many docs still point to **tofuNFT**; it’s closed. Update to **MoonBeans**, **Raresama**, or chain-native options.
* **Royalties across chains:** Cross-listing across standards can break royalties; start with a single primary venue, then expand.
* **Metadata durability:** Pin to IPFS with a reliable pinning/back-up plan to avoid broken art later.
* **Curation lead times:** If targeting **Raresama** or featured drops on **Chaotic**, plan for approvals and community coordination.

## FAQs
**Which Polkadot NFT marketplaces have the most activity right now?**
Activity is fragmented by chain and niche. For **EVM** flows, check **MoonBeans** and **Raresama** and their stats pages. For **Polkadot-native** and advanced features, check **Singular (RMRK)** and **Unique**. **Chaotic** is new but growing on Asset Hub.

1. **Is KodaDot gone? What’s Chaotic?**
**Chaotic** is a fresh marketplace from the Koda-aligned team, positioned as an evolution rather than a 1:1 replacement. It launched **public beta** in late August 2025 with early sell-outs.

2. **Can I move NFTs cross-chain on Polkadot?**
Yes. Projects have showcased **NFT-focused cross-chain messaging** patterns (often called NFT-XCM). Confirm current docs before planning production flows.
