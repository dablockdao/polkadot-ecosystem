Singular NFT Marketplace Guide

Below we will delve into topics ranging from basic NFT concepts to advanced subjects like **Modular NFTs** and **Soulbound NFTs**. Additionally, it covers essential aspects of blockchain technology, including cryptocurrencies, crypto wallets, and safe navigation within the Web3 ecosystem.

### Getting Started with Singular

#### Setting Up a Crypto Wallet
To interact with the Singular marketplace, users need a crypto wallet. Singular recommends self-custody wallets like Metamask, Trust Wallet, SubWallet, and Talisman for their compatibility with NFTs and emphasis on user control. Detailed guides on setting up these wallets and best practices for securing private keys are available on the platform.

#### Connecting to Blockchain Networks
Singular supports various blockchain networks, including Moonbeam, Ethereum, and Polygon. Users can easily connect their wallets to these networks via Chainlist, simplifying the addition of blockchain networks to crypto wallets.

### Profile Setup and Verification

#### Setting Up Your Profile
Singular uses **Ethereum Name Service (ENS) t**o maintain decentralized profiles. Users can register and manage their ENS names directly on Singular, ensuring their profiles are consistent across various platforms. This process includes setting up a profile photo, adding personal information, and ensuring all details are correctly linked to the user’s wallet.

#### Verifying Your Collection
To request verification for an NFT collection on Singular, users need to create a collection with at least five unique NFTs, set up a profile with an ENS domain, and maintain a wallet with 10 RMRK tokens. Verified collections benefit from increased visibility and credibility, enhancing trust and engagement within the marketplace.

### Understanding Modular NFTs
Modular NFTs, or NFTs 2.0, represent the next generation of NFTs, offering extensibility, upgradability, and dynamic interactions. Singular’s Modular NFTs are built on several innovative standards:

- **Nestable**: NFTs can own and be owned by other NFTs, creating complex hierarchies and relationships.
- **Equippable**: NFTs can be equipped with other NFTs, enhancing their functionality and value.
- **Multi-asset**: NFTs can have multiple outputs, such as images, audio, and documents, which adapt to different platforms.
- **Soulbound**: NFTs that are permanently bound to an account or another NFT, making them non-transferable.

### Applications of Modular NFTs
#### Art
Modular NFTs allow artists to create interactive, multi-layered digital galleries and collaborative pieces that change based on user interaction, enhancing engagement and value.
#### Gaming
In gaming, Modular NFTs enable players to manage complex inventories, enhance characters with equippable items, and maintain a persistent identity across different platforms. Soulbound NFTs can represent player achievements and reputation, adding depth to the gaming experience.
#### Business
Businesses can use Modular NFTs for real estate representation, branded collectibles, and supply chain management. These NFTs ensure transparency, authenticity, and efficient management of digital and physical assets.
#### Community and Governance
Modular NFTs support decentralized governance by representing voting rights and reputations within DAOs. They facilitate transparent, secure decision-making processes and community engagement.
#### Museums and Public Goods
Museums can use Modular NFTs for digital preservation, interactive exhibits, and crowdfunding. Public goods projects and charities can tokenize their efforts, providing donors with unique, trackable digital assets.

## What is Singular and how does it work?
Singular is a Modular NFT marketplace that allows users to buy, sell, and trade both regular and advanced NFTs. Users can create or connect a wallet, browse digital items, and securely conduct transactions using blockchain technology.

## What are NFTs and why are they valuable?
NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are unique digital items representing ownership of a specific item or piece of content. They are valuable because they provide proof of ownership, scarcity, and authenticity. NFTs can represent anything from digital art to virtual real estate, and their value can increase based on demand and perceived importance.

## What is the difference between NFT 1.0 and Modular NFTs?
NFT 1.0 refers to the first generation of NFTs, focusing on single digital items. Modular NFTs expand on this concept by offering advanced features such as:
- **Multi-Asset NFTs**: Hold multiple assets within one token, offering more value and versatility.
- **Nestable NFTs**: Can own and be owned by other NFTs, creating complex hierarchies.
- **Equippable NFTs**: Can interact with other NFTs based on specified rules, enabling unique combinations and interactions.
- **Soulbound NFTs**: Permanently bound to another NFT or an account, making them non-transferable.

These innovations provide greater utility and creative possibilities, making NFTs more adaptable and functional across various applications and industries.
