Peaq is a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain specifically designed for **Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePINs)** and Machine-**Readable Worlds (MRWs)**. It offers a unique combination of scalability, security, and developer-friendliness, making it an ideal platform for building real-world applications.

## Peaq Network Key Features
- **Scalability:** peaq boasts a robust architecture capable of handling over 10,000 transactions per second (TPS) today, with the potential to scale beyond 500,000 TPS in the future.
- **Security:** peaq inherits its security from Polkadot, a leading blockchain protocol known for its strong decentralization. This ensures a high Nakamoto Coefficient, making peaq resistant to attacks.
- **Low Transaction Costs:** peaq offers transaction fees as low as $0.00025, thanks to its efficient architecture and the cost-effective blockspace provided by Polkadot.
- **Multi-Chain Capabilities:** peaq seamlessly interacts with Polkadot and other major blockchains like Cosmos, Solana, and Binance, enabling data and token transfer across ecosystems.
- **EVM Compatibility:** peaq supports both EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and ink! smart contracts, allowing developers familiar with Ethereum or Substrate to build on peaq with ease.
- **Ready-to-Use DePIN Functions:** peaq provides pre-built functionalities like self-sovereign Machine IDs, access control, and data verification, streamlining dApp development for DePINs.
- **Sustainability:** peaq utilizes a highly energy-efficient blockchain architecture, minimizing its environmental impact.
- **Large Developer Ecosystem:** By leveraging Polkadot and Substrate, peaq benefits from a vast pool of experienced developers, fostering a thriving development community.

## Peaq Network Core Technologies
- **Polkadot:** peaq leverages Polkadot’s security, scalability, and interoperability features.
- **Substrate:** Substrate provides the foundation for building high-performance blockchains like peaq.
- **EVM:** EVM compatibility allows developers to write and deploy Solidity smart contracts on peaq.
- **ink!:** ink! is a Rust-based smart contract language offering an alternative to Solidity.

## Building on peaq
Peaq offers a comprehensive developer toolkit, including:
- **SDKs:** peaq provides SDKs in JavaScript and other languages, allowing developers to interact with the network and its functionalities.
- **Block Explorers:** Explore the peaq network and analyze transactions using dedicated block explorers.
- **Substrate Pallets:** Developers can utilize pre-built pallets for common functionalities or create custom pallets for specific needs.

## Peaq Use Cases
peaq’s capabilities are well-suited for various DePIN and MRW applications, including:
- **Supply Chain Management:** Track and verify the movement of goods in real-time.
- **Manufacturing:** Automate processes and ensure machine-to-machine communication.
- **Energy Management:** Optimize energy usage and enable peer-to-peer energy trading.
- **Connected Cars:** Develop autonomous driving applications and facilitate secure vehicle data exchange.

### Conclusion
Peaq is a powerful blockchain platform enabling the development of secure, scalable, and interoperable applications for the Economy of Things. Its focus on DePINs and MRWs positions it as a key player in shaping the future of connected machines and real-world data.
