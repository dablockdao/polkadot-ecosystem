## peaq Network: The Polkadot DePIN Layer for the Machine Economy
peaq Network is a Polkadot-based Layer-1 purpose-built for Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN). It combines ultra-low fees, EVM + ink! support, and plug-and-play “Modular DePIN Functions” (IDs, access control, data verification, UMT) so founders can ship real-world apps across mobility, energy, connectivity, and more. Updated **September 2025**.

## ELI5: What peaq Network is
peaq is a **Layer-1 blockchain** that specializes in **DePIN**—apps where real-world machines and devices (cars, drones, routers, meters, rigs) earn, prove, and coordinate via on-chain logic. peaq runs as a **Polkadot parachain** (i.e., an application-specific L1 secured by the Relay Chain), inheriting shared security and native cross-chain messaging.

* **Low fees & high throughput** for machine-to-machine (M2M) interactions (fees reported as low as **\$0.00025**; throughput claims of **\~10,000 TPS** today, with a path to higher via elastic scaling). Treat these as vendor-reported figures—validate for your workload.
* **EVM + ink!** smart contract support: reuse Solidity or write ink! in Rust.
* **Modular DePIN Functions**: drop-in building blocks for machine identity, access, data verification, and **UMT** (nanosecond-grade time sync).

## Key features & architecture
### Ultra-low cost, throughput-oriented
peaq positions itself with **\~\$0.00025** transaction fees and **\~10,000 TPS** capacity, with roadmap scaling beyond **100k TPS** via Polkadot’s **Agile Coretime** and peaq’s elastic scaling approach. Independent live benchmarks are limited; pilot under realistic load.

### Security & decentralization via Polkadot
As a parachain, peaq shares Polkadot Relay Chain security and benefits from Nominated Proof-of-Stake decentralization. Polkadot’s **coretime** model lets parachains elastically buy compute (“cores”) as demand grows—useful for DePIN bursts.

### Multiruntime: EVM + ink!
* **EVM**: compatibility for tooling and Solidity contracts.
* **ink!**: Rust-based smart contracts (Substrate native), useful when you need fine-grained control and Wasm-first features.

## Modular DePIN Functions (how they work)
peaq ships **plug-and-play primitives** so you don’t reinvent infra:
1. **peaq ID (Self-Sovereign Machine ID)** – DID-style credentials so machines/devices identify and mutually authenticate. Useful for payments, rentals, and data attestations.
2. **peaq access (RBAC for machines)** – on-chain, role-based access control to gate machine capabilities (e.g., who can unlock a scooter; which drone can enter a zone).
3. **peaq verify (tiered data verification)** – patterns for validating physical data in a DePIN (crypto proofs, redundancy, economic checks).
4. **UMT (Universal Machine Time)** – an on-chain, Precision Time Protocol-style approach targeting **nanosecond-level** synchronization so robots/drones/vehicles can coordinate safely.

These functions are exposed via SDKs so web2/web3 teams can integrate quickly without deep Substrate expertise.

## Developer experience: SDKs, tooling, runtimes
* **SDKs:** Official **JavaScript** SDK, with **Python** also available.
* **Explorers & infra:** EVM/Substrate explorers and managed node services are available for development and production.
* **Runtimes:** Choose **EVM** for speed of porting; choose **ink!/pallets** for custom logic and tight runtime integration.

## Interoperability & Polkadot advantages
* **XCM:** Natively message across Polkadot parachains—move assets, invoke remote functions, or compose flows (e.g., settle on Asset Hub, call EVM on Moonbeam).
* **Agile Coretime:** Buy additional compute as your DePIN scales; better cost/performance alignment vs fixed auction slots.
* **“Parachain as L1”:** Parachains are sovereign L1s that **inherit shared security**—useful mental model when scoping trust boundaries.

## Token & economics (operational view)
* **Ticker:** PEAQ
* **Genesis supply:** **4,200,000,000** (per publicly shared tokenomics).
* **Utility:** fees, block production, governance, and machine trust primitives. Builders should treat token use as infra cost and design for end-user abstraction where possible.

## Mini-guide: Stand up a basic DePIN on peaq
**Goal:** A minimal “sensor-to-chain” loop using peaq ID, access control, and verified data.
1. **Create project & choose runtime**
   Decide **EVM** (Solidity) or **ink!** (Rust). For rapid iteration, start on EVM.
2. **Install SDK & connect**
   Add the peaq SDK (JS) and connect to a peaq RPC. Configure keys and environment.
3. **Issue Machine IDs**
   Mint or register **peaq IDs** for your device class (e.g., sensor node). Store DID locally with rotation policy.
4. **Attach access policy**
   Use **peaq access** to define roles (owner, maintainer, renter) and map on-chain permissions to device capabilities.
5. **Stream data with verification**
   Implement **peaq verify** tiers (signatures, redundancy, economic checks). Start with signature + multi-source corroboration.
6. **Time-sync critical ops**
   If coordination precision matters (drones, grids), integrate **UMT** for synchronized events and ordering.
7. **Payments & incentives**
   Wire usage fees, staking, or bounties. Keep fees abstracted; batch small txs or use meta-tx relays where feasible.
8. **Cross-chain flows (optional)**
   Use **XCM** to settle assets or trigger logic on other parachains (e.g., EVM calls on Moonbeam).
9. **Observability**
   Expose health metrics and build an indexer; verify device population and data volumes against explorer telemetry.
10. **Pilot, then scale coretime**
    As load grows, plan for **Agile Coretime** purchases to scale compute.

## Common pitfalls & pro tips
**1) Treat TPS/fee numbers as planning inputs, not SLAs.** Public materials cite **\~\$0.00025** fees and **\~10k TPS**; independent live TPS dashboards are sparse. Pilot with realistic load, then optimize batching.
**2) Secure device keys at the edge.** Rotate device credentials and store DIDs in secure elements; design for offline grace windows.
**3) Map RBAC to *physical* safety.** Don’t conflate wallet ownership with operational control; include geofences, rate-limits, and human overrides.
**4) Verify data economically.** Redundant sampling + slashing is often more robust than pure signatures.
**5) Plan for cross-chain UX.** Abstract XCM/fees with relays and avoid forcing users to hold multiple assets; prefer intent-based flows.
**6) Budget for Agile Coretime.** As you scale, model compute purchases in your unit economics.
