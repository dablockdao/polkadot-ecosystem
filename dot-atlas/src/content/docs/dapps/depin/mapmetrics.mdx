## MapMetrics DePIN: Drive-to-Earn Navigation, Now in the Polkadot/peaq Era
MapMetrics is a decentralized navigation and mapping project (DePIN) that rewards users for contributing driving and geospatial data. This guide explains how MapMetrics works, its peaq/Polkadot alignment, token and rewards mechanics, how it compares to other mobility DePINs, and how to get started—fast.

## What is MapMetrics (and why it matters)
**MapMetrics** is a community-driven navigation and mapping network. Users contribute real-time driving/road data via a smartphone app and earn crypto rewards; the network then aggregates this data to power live maps, traffic insights, and B2B datasets. Think “Waze meets Web3,” but with ownership and rewards aligned to contributors.

In 2024–2025, MapMetrics aligned with **peaq**, a Polkadot parachain purpose-built for DePIN, to leverage machine identity and modular DePIN functions—part of a broader shift of mobility DePINs toward Polkadot’s shared security and interoperability.

## Quick ELI5
* **You drive with the MapMetrics app on.**
* **The app collects anonymous map signals** (traffic, road events) and contributes them to a decentralized dataset.
* **You get tokens** for useful contributions.
* **Businesses and apps** can use the data; the network’s economics recycle value back to contributors.

## How MapMetrics works
### Data capture
* **Smartphone app** records GPS and in-app signals while you navigate.
* **Events & telemetry** (e.g., congestion) feed a **live data map** and **traffic updates** roadmap items.

### Rewarding contributions
MapMetrics rewards users for app activity and contributions. Earlier materials emphasize **time-in-app and ad interactions**; the current app listing promotes **distance-based** earning. Reward logic may vary by app version and campaigns—check the in-app docs for the latest.

### Product surface
* **Offline/online navigation** with privacy focus.
* **Live traffic & data map**, **B2B portal**, and a **routing SDK** planned/rolling out per the 2025 roadmap.

## Architecture & the peaq/Polkadot connection
MapMetrics is integrating with **peaq**—a Polkadot parachain specialized for DePIN—to use **peaq ID** (machine identity), role-based access control, and other modular DePIN components. This supports secure, verifiable device identities and on-chain accounting for devices and data. peaq apps are natively interoperable across Polkadot via **XCM**.

MapMetrics publicly announced its migration away from a Solana-only footprint to peaq to leverage these DePIN-specific primitives and ecosystem fit.

**Why Polkadot/peaq for DePIN?**

* DePIN-oriented L1 with modular functions (IDs, payments, access).
* Shared security plus interoperability with parachains (governance, assets, tooling).
* Architectural headroom for high throughput and multi-chain device IDs.

## Token & rewards mechanics
* The project historically references **MMAPS** as its token on price trackers (max supply \~64.29B), though the 2025 roadmap also notes “token listing DEX/CEX,” suggesting evolving token plans. Treat all prices/supplies as provisional and verify in-app/official channels before decisions. *(This is not investment advice.)*
* **Earning basis:** messaging has ranged from **time-based** accrual during navigation to **distance-based** earning in the latest store description; the network also ties rewards to app engagement and data quality.

> **Disclaimer:** Tokens are volatile and program terms change. Always check official docs/app updates.

## Use cases: from traffic to enterprise data
* **Real-time traffic & routing:** fresher local signals improve ETAs and route choices.
* **Hyper-local map enrichment:** points of interest and community voting (“map-to-earn”) broaden beyond driving only.
* **B2B/SDK:** developers and fleets can consume aggregated, privacy-preserving map data via a portal/Routing SDK.

| **MapMetrics** | Navigation signals, traffic, POIs | Smartphone app       | Time/distance & engagement (varies by version) | Integrating with **peaq** (Polkadot) | Live traffic/data map, B2B portal, Routing SDK (2025 roadmap)     |
| **Hivemapper** | Street-level imagery for maps     | **Dashcam** required | Coverage/quality-weighted, HONEY token         | **Solana**                           | Real-time map, token burns tied to usage; strong imagery pipeline |
| **DIMO**       | Vehicle telematics/diagnostics    | OBD dongle/app       | Data sharing, referrals, developer usage       | Migrating to **Base** (was Polygon)  | “Global API for cars,” growing dev console & partnerships         |
| **NATIX**      | Smartphone AI dashcam mapping     | Smartphone app       | Drive-and-earn, AI-detected events             | peaq functions; Solana in stack      | Massive smartphone-first scaling; peaq ID integration             |

*Why MapMetrics stands out:* smartphone-first onboarding (no mandatory hardware), navigation UX, and a Polkadot-aligned stack via peaq’s machine identity and modular functions.

## Step-by-step: start earning with MapMetrics
1. **Install the app** (Android; iOS availability may vary by region). Enable permissions for location and background activity.
2. **Create/secure your wallet** in-app. Back up keys/phrases safely (offline).
3. **Drive with the app active.** Keep GPS and motion permissions on; respect local laws (phone mounts recommended).
4. **Engage with map tasks.** Report POIs, validate community content where available.
5. **Monitor rewards** and read in-app docs for the current reward logic (time vs distance, quests/airdrops).
6. **Optional (builders):** explore the **B2B portal**/**Routing SDK** for fleet or app integrations (per roadmap).

**Mini-checklist**
* Phone mount + charger (continuous GPS drains battery).
* Background app refresh + precise location ON.
* Update app weekly for reward logic changes/new quests.
* If you’re a builder, register interest for SDK/portal access.

## Common pitfalls & pro tips
* **“I didn’t earn much today.”** Rewards vary by **mechanics and campaign**. Some releases emphasize time-in-app; recent store copy references distance. Check app version notes.
* **Battery drain/GPS drift.** Use a mount + power, and allow high-accuracy location.
* **Coverage gaps.** New cities may have limited data; contributions there can become more valuable as networks target novelty/quality metrics.
* **Token liquidity/volatility.** MMAPS and related tokens can be illiquid or volatile; never assume rewards equal cash—read the latest listings/markets.
* **Identity & privacy.** peaq ID enables device-level identity without exposing personal data; always review app privacy settings.

## FAQs
**1) Is MapMetrics legit?**
It’s an active DePIN project with a live app and public roadmap. As with all DePINs, reward terms evolve—read the in-app docs.

**2) Do I need to buy hardware?**
No. MapMetrics is **smartphone-first**; a stable mount helps. (Contrast with Hivemapper’s dashcam.)

**3) Are rewards based on time or distance?**
Both models have been referenced. Earlier docs stress **time/ad interaction**, while the latest Android listing mentions **distance**. The app may run campaigns that tweak this—check release notes.

**4) What chain does MapMetrics use?**
MapMetrics announced a migration from a Solana-only setup toward **peaq** to leverage DePIN-specific primitives on Polkadot.

**5) What is peaq ID and why should I care?**
It’s a **self-sovereign machine identity** for devices. It helps verify contributions from specific devices without doxxing users, improving data integrity and automations for payouts/access.

**6) Does MapMetrics support offline navigation?**
Yes—the app highlights offline/online modes and privacy focus.

**7) Can businesses use MapMetrics data?**
Yes—MapMetrics’ roadmap calls out a **B2B portal** and **Routing SDK** for integrations.

**8) How does this compare to DIMO or NATIX?**
DIMO focuses on vehicle data via dongles/apps (migrating to Base); NATIX is smartphone AI dashcam mapping and uses peaq’s modular functions. MapMetrics is navigation-first with peaq alignment.

## Conclusion
MapMetrics sits at the intersection of **navigation UX** and **DePIN economics**, with a growing tilt toward **Polkadot/peaq** for device identity and interoperability. If you’re a driver, try the app and learn the current reward model. If you’re a builder, explore the 2025 roadmap—especially the B2B portal and SDK—to integrate MapMetrics data into your mobility apps and analytics.
