Astar Network is a blockchain platform built on Polkadot, aiming to become the premier destination for decentralized applications (dApps). **It supports both Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and WebAssembly (Wasm) environments**, enabling developers to leverage the strengths of both paradigms.

# Key Features of Astar Network
- **Interoperability:** Astar Network boasts a unique interoperability framework that allows dApps to interact with each other seamlessly across different blockchains within the Polkadot ecosystem. This fosters innovation and collaboration among developers.
- **dApp Staking:** Astar‚Äôs innovative dApp Staking mechanism incentivizes developers by allowing token holders to stake their ASTR tokens on their preferred dApps. This not only rewards developers for building valuable applications but also fuels the growth of the Astar ecosystem.
- **Scalability:** Unlike traditional blockchains, Astar Network overcomes scalability limitations. It utilizes a sharded architecture, efficiently processing a high volume of transactions without compromising security.
- **Security:** Astar Network leverages the shared security of Polkadot, ensuring a robust and reliable environment for dApps.

## Astar Token (ASTR)
ASTR is the native token of Astar Network and serves three primary functions:
- **Staking:** ASTR holders can stake their tokens on dApps to earn rewards and support the projects they believe in.
- **Transactions:** Every transaction on the Astar Network requires a fee, paid in ASTR. A portion of these fees is burned, while the remainder is distributed to network validators.
- **Governance:** ASTR token holders participate in on-chain governance, shaping the future of Astar Network through voting on critical proposals.

## dApp Staking Explained
dApp Staking is a cornerstone of the Astar Network ecosystem. It provides a win-win situation for all stakeholders:
- **Developers:** Earn a basic income through staked ASTR tokens, allowing them to focus on building innovative dApps.
- **Stakers:** Earn rewards by supporting their favorite dApps and contributing to the network‚Äôs growth.  
  dApps: Gain access to a larger user base and attract investment through increased visibility and user participation.
- **dApp Staking V3:** The latest version of dApp Staking introduces a more granular reward system with tiers based on the total value staked on a dApp. This incentivizes competition and ensures fair distribution of rewards.

## Participating in Astar Network
Astar offers various ways to get involved in its ecosystem:
- **Stakers:** ASTR holders can stake their tokens on the Astar Portal to support dApps and earn rewards.
- **Developers:** Developers can build dApps on Astar Network, taking advantage of its unique features and dApp Staking incentives.
- **Users:** Users can interact with a wide range of dApps built on Astar Network, enjoying a secure and interoperable experience.

## A Deep Dive into Astar Network‚Äôs Family of Networks
Before diving into development on Astar Network, choosing the right network is crucial. Astar offers a variety of options catering to different needs, from isolated development environments to live testing grounds. Let‚Äôs explore each network in detail:

#### Local Networks:
- **Substrate Node:** Ideal for those comfortable with code. You can either build the local node from source or use a pre-built binary. This offers complete control but requires some technical expertise.
- **Swanky Node:** Designed for Wasm smart contract development. This pre-configured Substrate node streamlines the local development process.
- **Zombienet:** Perfect for testing scenarios with full control. Zombienet allows you to download and configure a local test network with a customizable Relay Chain and parachains. This is great for simulating complex interactions.

#### Testnets:
- **Shibuya (Substrate):** The closest mirror to Astar‚Äôs mainnet. Shibuya operates as a parachain on the internal Tokio Relay Chain, providing a real-world testing environment for developers. It uses the SBY token, obtainable from the Astar Portal faucet.
- **zKyoto (Sepolia):** While deprecated, it‚Äôs worth mentioning for historical context. zKyoto was an early zkEVM testnet utilizing zk rollup technology.

#### Mainnets:
- **Shiden Parachain (Substrate):** A live ‚Äúcanary network‚Äù connected to Kusama. Shiden serves as a proving ground for new Astar runtime features before deployment on the mainnet. It has its own tokenomics with the SDN token.
- **Astar Parachain (Substrate):** The heart of the Astar ecosystem, connected to the Polkadot Relay Chain. This is where real-world dApps are deployed and the ASTR token is used.
- **Astar zkEVM:** A Layer 2 scaling solution built on top of Ethereum. This Validium-based network leverages Polygon AggLayer, offering scalability and security benefits to Ethereum dApps.

## Choosing the Right Network:
- **Local Networks:** Use these for initial development and testing in a controlled environment.
- **Shibuya Testnet:** Perfect for simulating real-world conditions before deploying to a mainnet.
- **Shiden Parachain:** Ideal for testing new features and functionalities before pushing them to the Astar mainnet.
- **Astar Parachain:** This is where your dApp goes live for the world to use.
- **Astar zkEVM:** Utilize this for Ethereum dApps seeking faster transaction processing and lower fees.

By understanding the distinct functionalities of each network, you can select the most suitable environment for your development needs within the Astar ecosystem.
