## Moonbeam Network: The EVM Gateway to Polkadot (2025 Builder’s Guide)
Moonbeam Network is Polkadot’s EVM-compatible smart-contract hub that lets you build with familiar Ethereum tooling while tapping Polkadot’s native cross-chain rails. This guide explains Moonbeam’s architecture (XC-20s, XCM, GMP), 2025 upgrades, cross-chain options (Wormhole, Axelar, LayerZero, Hyperlane), and hands-on steps to route liquidity and ship production dapps.

## Quick ELI5: Moonbeam in one minute
Moonbeam is like **an Ethereum city inside Polkadot**. You can deploy Solidity contracts and use MetaMask, but you also get **native cross-chain** highways to every other Polkadot parachain. Assets are **XC-20s**—ERC-20s that “speak XCM,” Polkadot’s message format, so tokens can move natively across chains. For non-Polkadot chains, Moonbeam plugs into **GMP** protocols (Wormhole, Axelar, LayerZero, Hyperlane) to route liquidity and messages.

## How Moonbeam works on Polkadot
### EVM compatibility + unified accounts
Moonbeam is fully EVM-compatible and uses **unified accounts**: your standard Ethereum H160 address (0x…) controls both EVM and Substrate-based features (staking, governance, XCM) on Moonbeam. This removes the “two-accounts” friction found on many EVM-on-Substrate chains.

**Why this matters**
* You keep MetaMask + Solidity + Hardhat workflow.
* You still get Polkadot features (OpenGov, XCM) from the same address.

### XC-20s and XCM precompiles
**XC-20** = ERC-20 that’s also XCM-aware. Any ERC-20 deployed on Moonbeam can be configured as an XC-20 and sent to/from parachains using XCM. Moonbeam exposes **X-Tokens/XCM precompiles** so Solidity contracts can call Substrate XCM methods directly (addresses are stable across networks).
* X-Tokens precompile: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000804`
* XCM precompile: `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000081A`

### Cross-chain messaging (GMP) & Routed Liquidity
For non-Polkadot chains, Moonbeam integrates **Wormhole, Axelar, LayerZero, and Hyperlane** so apps can pass messages/tokens across ecosystems. Moonbeam introduced **GMP precompile** and the **Moonbeam Routed Liquidity (MRL)** pattern: assets bridge into Moonbeam via a GMP protocol and are **immediately routed** to a destination parachain over XCM — typically invisible to the user.

> Think of MRL as a **port parachain**: liquidity from Ethereum/Solana/etc. arrives via a GMP protocol, then Moonbeam forwards it natively to your Polkadot destination (e.g., HydraDX, Interlay) in one flow.

### Consensus & performance
Moonbeam runs a parachain consensus framework (Nimbus) and benefits from Polkadot upgrades like **Asynchronous Backing** (faster inclusion) and **Elastic Scaling**. In 2024/25, Moonbeam reduced block times to \~6s and increased throughput (\~4× gas per block; \~8× effective throughput) as part of its roadmap alignment with the Polkadot SDK and Agile Coretime.


## What’s new in 2025
Moonbeam’s **2025 product roadmap** highlights:
* **Throughput & latency:** Asynchronous Backing integrated; further **Elastic Scaling** work through 2025 with a target toward lower block times.
* **Asset Hub alignment:** As Polkadot consolidates user-facing assets on **Asset Hub**, Moonbeam treats Asset Hub reserves for xc assets and guides dapps through associated migration tasks.
* **Moonbeam ↔ Moonriver pathing:** A trust-minimized path using Polkadot SDK bridging components is planned to simplify GLMR/MOVR flows.
* **Permissionless foreign asset registration:** Deposit-based, self-serve listings reduce governance friction.
* **Treasury spends in stables:** Process/runtime updates to enable payouts beyond the native token.
* **Passkeys & UX:** Work toward **passkey (secp256r1)** support for smart wallets; faster RPC import; gas/PoV optimizations (PoV limit doubled to 10 MB).
* **Tokenomics update (Runtime 3800):** After total GLMR supply reaches **1.2B**, inflation becomes **linear and capped at up to 60M GLMR/year (\~5%)**. Always verify latest on-chain parameters.

## When to choose Moonbeam vs Moonriver
* **Moonbeam (Polkadot):** Production-grade security, deeper liquidity, “home” for cross-chain dapps targeting Polkadot + external ecosystems.
* **Moonriver (Kusama):** Faster iteration environment with similar stack; some teams pilot here before porting to Moonbeam. (Token models are distinct; check docs.)

## Cross-chain options on Moonbeam (comparison)
| Protocol      | What it is                      | Message type                       | Typical uses on Moonbeam                                                 | Notes                                                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Wormhole**  | Guardian-secured GMP network    | Arbitrary msgs + token bridge      | **MRL** routes: bridge in → route via XCM to parachain; asset migrations | Widely integrated across many chains; MRL reference path.     |
| **Axelar**    | Validator-secured GMP + routing | Arbitrary msgs + token bridge      | Cross-chain calls (e.g., mint NFT, remote exec), Squid routing           | Used in connected-contracts demos and app flows.              |
| **LayerZero** | DVN-based omnichain messaging   | Arbitrary msgs; Stargate liquidity | DAOs, omnichain NFTs, custom relayers                                    | Endpoint available for Moonbeam; popular for app-level logic. |
| **Hyperlane** | Permissionless interop          | Arbitrary msgs                     | Additional destinations; sovereignty options                             | Alternate routing + security model.                           |

> For **in-ecosystem** movement (parachain ↔ parachain), use **XCM/XC-20**. For **external ecosystems**, use **GMP**, and consider **MRL** to land assets directly on the destination parachain.

## Mini-guide: Route USDC from Ethereum to a Polkadot parachain via Moonbeam
**Goal:** End with USDC (or a target representation) on a destination parachain (e.g., **HydraDX**) without manual hops.

1. **Choose origin & destination**
   * Origin: Ethereum (USDC).
   * Destination: Target parachain needing liquidity (e.g., HydraDX).

2. **Pick the route**
   * Use an **MRL-enabled** UI (e.g., a Carrier-powered flow in ecosystem apps). Under the hood, **Wormhole** brings USDC → Moonbeam, then **XCM** routes it to the destination parachain.

3. **Connect wallet & quote**
   * Connect your EVM wallet; select token and chain route; review estimated fees (origin gas + bridging relayer + XCM execution).

4. **Bridge (GMP step)**
   * Approve & send USDC from Ethereum. A VAA/message is generated and submitted to Moonbeam’s **GMP precompile**.

5. **Route (XCM step)**
   * On delivery, Moonbeam forwards the payload via XCM to the parachain (e.g., HydraDX), crediting your address there.

6. **Verify & use**
   * Open the destination parachain app/wallet; verify balance; proceed to LP, lend, or swap.

**Notes**
* The MRL flow is **atomic for users**: assets effectively “spend no time” on Moonbeam—they’re routed on arrival.
* If a relayer fails, recover by manually invoking the **GMP precompile** with the message/attestation.

## Common pitfalls & pro tips
* **Wrong MultiLocation or underestimated weights:** Use audited examples; verify **XCM weights** and **fee** estimates to avoid stuck messages. Start on **Moonbase Alpha**.
* **Wrapped vs native assets:** MRL typically uses **wrapped representations**; be explicit about asset provenance in UI/labels.
* **Foreign asset registration:** With **deposit-based** registration, plan the deposit and metadata steps into your launch runbook.
* **Throughput vs PoV limits:** Polkadot’s PoV limit increased to **10 MB**; Moonbeam runtimes reflect this, but gas/fee tuning is ongoing—budget headroom.
* **Tokenomics references:** If you mention GLMR issuance/inflation, align to **Runtime 3800**; avoid APR or price claims.

## FAQs
**1) What is Moonbeam Network, in practical terms?**
An EVM parachain on Polkadot with unified H160 accounts and contracts that can trigger **native cross-chain** actions via XCM and integrate **GMP** protocols for external chains.

**2) What are XC-20 tokens?**
ERC-20s that also “speak XCM,” enabling trust-minimized moves to/from other parachains. Configure an ERC-20 on Moonbeam as an XC-20 and use X-Tokens/XCM precompiles to transfer.

**3) How does Moonbeam Routed Liquidity (MRL) differ from normal bridging?**
MRL is **two-step under the hood**: bridge to Moonbeam via a GMP protocol (e.g., Wormhole), then **auto-route** to a parachain via XCM—appearing as one seamless action to users.

**4) What cross-chain protocols are supported?**
Moonbeam documents **Wormhole, Axelar, LayerZero, and Hyperlane** with guides, templates, and endpoint references.

**5) How fast is Moonbeam in 2025?**
Following Polkadot improvements like **Asynchronous Backing**, Moonbeam reduced block times to \~6s and increased throughput. Ongoing **Elastic Scaling** work targets further reductions.

**6) Did GLMR tokenomics change?**
Yes: after total supply hits **1.2B GLMR**, inflation becomes **linear and capped at up to 60M/yr (\~5%)** per Runtime 3800.

**7) What’s the difference between Moonbeam and Moonriver?**
Sister networks: Moonbeam (Polkadot) is the main production hub; **Moonriver (Kusama)** favors faster iteration. Token distributions and network roles differ.

**8) Where should I start building?**
Prototype on **Moonbase Alpha**, then deploy to Moonriver or Moonbeam. Use official precompile addresses and guides for XCM and GMP.

## Conclusion
Moonbeam gives Ethereum teams a **production EVM** on Polkadot plus **first-class interop**: XC-20s/XCM for parachains and GMP routes for external chains. If you’re building cross-chain DeFi, RWA, or gaming, Moonbeam is a practical way to consolidate UX while expanding reach.
