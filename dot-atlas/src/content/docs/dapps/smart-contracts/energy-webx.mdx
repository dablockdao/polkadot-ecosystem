Energy Web is a non-profit organization on a mission to accelerate the global transition to clean energy. They achieve this by developing open-source software solutions that empower companies to unlock the value of clean and distributed energy resources.

At the core of Energy Web’s technology lies the **Energy Web Decentralized Operating System (EW-DOS)**. EW-DOS provides companies with the tools to build custom applications and business networks that leverage established protocols alongside pioneering technologies.

## Key Components of Energy Web
- **Energy Web Chain (EWC):** A public, enterprise-grade blockchain designed specifically for the energy sector’s needs. It provides a secure and transparent platform for data exchange and transaction settlement.
- **Energy Web Token (EWT):** The native utility token of the EWC, used for staking and various services within the EW-DOS ecosystem.
- **Open-source software tools and standards:** EW-DOS offers a comprehensive suite of open-source software tools and standards that developers can leverage to build dApps (decentralized applications) tailored to the energy sector.

## What Problems Does Energy Web Solve?
Energy Web tackles two critical challenges in the current energy market:

- **Facilitating data sharing and collaboration:** EW-DOS empowers market participants to seamlessly share information and coordinate operations, maximizing the value of clean energy resources.
- **Enabling transparent and efficient renewable energy marketplaces:** Energy Web fosters open and scalable marketplaces for buying and selling renewable energy, ensuring trust and transparency throughout the process.
