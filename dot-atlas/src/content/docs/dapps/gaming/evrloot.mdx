## Evrloot Key Features

### Addressing Blockchain Gaming Challenges
Blockchain gaming often faces issues with unsustainable Pay-to-Earn (P2E) and Pay-to-Win (P2W) models, which can detract from the overall player experience. Evrloot addresses these problems by:

- **Avoiding P2E and P2W Models**: Focuses on creating a fair and enjoyable game for all players, regardless of their financial investment.

    - **Gameplay**: Players collect herbs such as Glade Grass and Mirage Sprouts, which can be used to craft various potions and remedies.
2. **Alchemy:**
    - **Overview**: The practice of transforming natural materials into powerful potions and tinctures.
