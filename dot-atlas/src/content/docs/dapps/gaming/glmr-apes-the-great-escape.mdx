GLMR APES is an innovative NFT project that has garnered significant attention within the Polkadot ecosystem. Launched in January 2022, this collection of 1001 pixel art apes quickly became the first ever sold-out collection on the Moonbeam network. The GLMR APES community, known for its dynamic participation, has been instrumental in the development of “The Great Escape,” a pioneering web3 game that leverages the unique capabilities of blockchain technology.

## The Genesis of GLMR APES
From its inception, GLMR APES has been more than just an NFT collection. It represents a vibrant community-driven project that empowers its members through a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). The DAO, known as the Apemocracy, allows GLMR APE holders to participate in governance, propose changes, and vote on crucial decisions, fostering a sense of ownership and involvement.

### Key Features of the Apemocracy
- **Wise Ape Elections:** Every four months, DAO members can stand for election to become Wise Apes, who are part of the Jungle Council. This council includes three permanent core team members and four elected Wise Apes, ensuring a balance between experienced guidance and fresh perspectives.
- **On-Chain Proposals:** GLMR APE holders can push proposals and vote on various initiatives, making the decision-making process transparent and democratic.
- **Recent DAO Votes:**
  - **GLMB Rewards Experiment:** Introduction of a new infrastructure leveraging Moonbeam for NFTs and liquidity (April 30, 2024).
  - **NFT Renting:** Implementation of a single token model for renting NFTs through Double Protocol (April 16, 2024).
  - **Community Maps:** Decision to introduce DUCK RACE as the first community map in The Great Escape (April 3, 2024).

## The Great Escape: A New Era of Web3 Gaming
The Great Escape stands as the first web3 NFT game deployed on the Moonbeam network, embodying the principles of decentralization and community governance. This 2D play-and-earn platformer invites players to embark on a fruit-picking adventure, using their favorite GLMR APE or JUNGLE NFT, or even a free Gibbon character.

### The Great Escape Gameplay Mechanics
- **Objective:** Players must collect as many fruits as possible within a level filled with enemies and traps.
- **Scoring:** At the end of the game, scores are calculated based on the number of fruits collected. Weekly rewards in GLMR and GLMB tokens are distributed to top players and a random selection of participants.
- **Characters:** The game features four different tribes of GLMR Jungle Apes (Gorillas, Chimpanzees, Orangutans, Bonobos), each with unique in-game characteristics that offer strategic advantages.

### The GLMR APES Roadmap Till Now
GLMR APES has meticulously planned its development, achieving several milestones:
- **January 2022:** Launch and sell-out of 1001 NFTs.
- **February 2022:** DAO creation and start of NFT staking.
- **April 2022:** Minting of GLMR Jungle NFTs.
- **August 2023:** Closed alpha and beta testing of The Great Escape.
- **December 2023:** Listing on Playstore.
