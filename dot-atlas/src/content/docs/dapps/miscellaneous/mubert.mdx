Mubert is a creator focused protocol that combines generative AI and Web3 to register, attribute, license, and monetize music and other media. The project operates a Substrate based parachain in the Polkadot ecosystem and offers a production grade API for real time music generation and streaming.

## Mubert Main value
* Verifiable ownership and provenance recorded on chain
* Machine readable licensing with automatic royalty distribution
* Attribution that covers human created and AI assisted works
* Developer ready access to generative music through a public API

## Mubert Key components
* **Polkadot parachain**
  Dedicated chain that hosts intellectual property logic, benefits from shared security, and uses XCM for interoperability.
* **IP Onchain pallet**
  Runtime module that represents works, datasets, and derivative links. It provides calls for registration, policy configuration, usage recording, and settlement.
* **MM25 music metadata**
  Schema that captures contributors, stems and loops, instruments, model and dataset references, license terms, and usage constraints.
* **Creative Data Token**
  Asset used for data and content transactions, royalty splits, access control, and community signaling such as staking on artists or genres.
* **Mubert API**
  Text to music and image to music generation with genre and mood controls, long form streaming, and easy integration for applications that need immediate audio delivery.

## How it works
1. A creator or rights holder describes an asset with MM25 and registers it on the parachain.
2. A policy defines permitted uses and the split tree for revenue.
3. Applications request music through the API or interact with the chain through RPC.
4. Usage events are recorded for attribution and periodic settlement distributes proceeds to credited parties.

## Primary use cases
* Adaptive soundtracks for games, fitness, and live streaming
* Background music for social video with built in attribution
* Programmatic licensing for brands and retail environments
* Marketplaces for datasets, stems, and genre specific AI agents

## Who benefits
* Creators and labels seeking transparent attribution and payouts
* Developers building UGC platforms, games, and interactive media
* Data and model providers who want revenue sharing when their assets power derivative works

## Why Polkadot
* Shared security and predictable upgrades for media scale event volumes
* Cross chain messaging that connects identity, payments, and content services
* Flexible runtime for specialized intellectual property logic

## Signals of traction
Public materials indicate long term API usage, an active creator network, and completion of a Web3 Foundation grant milestone, suggesting readiness for production integrations within the Polkadot community.

## Summary
Mubert delivers a coherent stack for the creator economy that unites a Polkadot parachain, an IP oriented Substrate pallet, the MM25 metadata standard for music, and a mature generation API. The design emphasizes clear provenance, enforceable policy, and scalable settlement to support sustainable monetization for both AI native and human made content.
