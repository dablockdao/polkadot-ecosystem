Jamton is an emerging Layer-2 network that aggregates liquidity and staking across **The Open Network (TON)** and **Polkadot**, giving users a single venue for high-yield staking, cross-chain transfers, and DeFi execution. Built with **Substrate** and secured by the Polkadot relay chain, Jamton operates as a parachain while simultaneously acting as a scaling layer for TON-based assets and applications.

## Jamton Technical Foundations

| Component               | Purpose                                               | Key Detail                                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Substrate Parachain** | Execution environment with shared security            | Won Polkadot parachain slot and connects to the relay chain                      |
| **Layer-2 for TON**     | Off-loads throughput and expands TON‚Äôs feature set    | Accelerates transaction finality for stTON and other TON assets                  |
| **XCM Bridges**         | Native cross-chain messaging                          | Active channel to Polkadot Asset Hub; roadmap includes Ethereum & Bitcoin        |
| **EVM Compatibility**   | Solidity smart-contract support                       | Lets Ethereum dApps deploy on Jamton while tapping Polkadot security             |

Jamton leverages **Polkadot‚Äôs parallelized transaction processing** and native cross-chain messaging (XCM) to coordinate asset transfers between TON, Polkadot, and other ecosystems.

## Jamton Financial Primitives

### Liquid Staking & DOTON

Twin liquid-staking modules accept **TON** and **DOT** deposits. They mint a single composable asset, **DOTON**, representing a blended staking position. DOTON can be held, traded, or restaked to capture extra protocol rewards and network fees.

### Restaking & Yield Optimisation

A native restaking engine reallocates DOTON across top-performing validators and employs MEV strategies (e.g., back-running large swaps) to maximise net yield. Rebalancing is automatic, removing the need for manual redelegation.

## Liquidity Infrastructure

* **Cross-Chain Bridges** ‚Äì Canonical bridges for TON ‚Üî Polkadot today; plans for Ethereum L2s and Bitcoin Taproot Assets.  
* **Integrated Order-Book DEX** ‚Äì ‚ÄúCapital DEX‚Äù merges an AMM pool with an on-chain order book so market-makers and passive LPs share liquidity.  
* **Telegram Mini App** ‚Äì Staking, swapping, and governance tools embedded directly in Telegram, Ton users‚Äô primary channel.  

## Jamton Governance & Security

Jamton adopts **Polkadot OpenGov** pallets for on-chain upgrades, treasury spending, and parameter changes. Token-weighted voting will gradually hand control to DOTON holders, while the relay chain‚Äôs validator set enforces economic security at consensus.

## Developer & User Experience

* **Unified API surface** ‚Äì Substrate RPC plus Ethereum-style JSON-RPC.  
* **SDKs & Tooling** ‚Äì TypeScript SDK, Solidity templates, and ink! examples streamline dApp migration.  
* **Abstract Accounts** ‚Äì Planned ERC-4337-style account abstraction to simplify UX across wallets.  

## Jamton Roadmap & Ecosystem Traction

| EVM pallet + Capital DEX         | üîÑ Q4 25 | Adds order-book trading and MEV-aware routing                  |
| Telegram Mini App GA             | üîÑ Q1 26 | Full staking + governance in Telegram                          |

Current partners include wallet providers **Ton Keeper**, **Nova**, and **SubWallet**, plus **Chainlink** for oracle price feeds.

## Competitive Positioning

1. **Dual-chain collateral** ‚Äì Combined TON + DOT exposure offers broader yield options than single-asset LSDs.  
2. **Polkadot security layer** ‚Äì Parachain status delivers shared security and native cross-chain messaging unavailable to standalone L2s.  
3. **Telegram distribution** ‚Äì Direct line to TON‚Äôs retail base via Mini Apps, a channel competitors lack.  

## Conclusion

Jamton positions itself as a **cross-chain liquidity and staking aggregator** that merges TON‚Äôs billion-user potential with Polkadot‚Äôs multi-chain infrastructure. Successful roll-out of DOTON, the Capital DEX, and a friction-less Telegram experience could make Jamton a pivotal gateway between Telegram‚Äôs community and Polkadot‚Äôs DeFi landscape, while providing developers an EVM-compatible canvas backed by relay-chain security. Continued progress on governance decentralisation and bridge hardening will determine whether Jamton achieves durable network effects and realises its vision of seamless, high-yield liquidity across chains.
