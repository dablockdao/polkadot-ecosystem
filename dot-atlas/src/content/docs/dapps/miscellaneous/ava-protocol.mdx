## Ava Protocol: Private, Autonomous Cross-Chain Transactions for Polkadot & EVM
Ava Protocol (formerly OAK Network) is an event-driven automation layer that lets builders ship **private, autonomous “super-transactions”** across chains. It combines an **EigenLayer AVS** security model with **TEE-backed confidentiality** and a no-code **Studio** for visual workflows—useful for DeFi, RWAs, DAOs, and AI agents with EVM endpoints and Polkadot ties.

## Why this matters (problem → benefit)
**Problem:** Cross-chain ops are brittle. Teams stitch triggers, bots, relayers, and wallets; users leak alpha in the mempool; MEV risk grows with every hop.
**Benefit:** Ava provides **event-driven execution** (time/price/state), **verifiable security** via an **EigenLayer AVS**, and **confidential automation** powered by TEEs—so complex, multi-step flows can run **autonomously and privately** across chains.
## ELI5
Think of Ava as a **smart robot assistant for your crypto**. You tell it: “*When price hits X or contract Y emits event Z, do these actions in order.*” It watches, decides, and **executes automatically**—and it can do so **privately** (hiding sensitive parameters) and **across multiple chains**.

## What is Ava Protocol?
Ava Protocol is an **Actively Validated Service (AVS)** built on **EigenLayer** that powers **autonomous smart-contract execution**—“super-transactions”—on EVM chains. The project **rebranded from OAK Network** to reflect a broader multi-chain vision. On top of the AVS, **Ava Protocol Studio** (a no-code builder) lets teams compose visual, event-driven workflows (triggers, branches, actions), deploy them to Ethereum/L2s, and monitor execution.

## How Ava Protocol works
### 1) EigenLayer-secured AVS
* **Restaked ETH** and a decentralized **operator** set back the correctness of automations.
* This provides a credibly neutral security layer and scale to EVMs and rollups.

### 2) Event-driven execution (“super-transactions”)
* Workflows fire on **time**, **price**, or **on-chain state** (oracle conditions, contract events, block intervals).
* Actions can batch swaps, route liquidity, orchestrate treasury movements, or manage RWA lifecycles.

### 3) Privacy & MEV mitigation
* **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)** protect sensitive logic and parameters (e.g., trigger thresholds, amounts) during automation.
* **Private transaction routing** mitigates mempool exposure to reduce frontrunning and sandwich risk.

### 4) Agent-ready design
* Ava targets **AI-native agents**: workflows can observe, decide, and act with **verifiable execution guarantees**, programmable **smart wallets** (ERC-4337/6900), and decentralized triggers.

## Ava Protocol & the Polkadot ecosystem
* **Origins as OAK Network (Polkadot/Kusama):** OAK won a Polkadot parachain auction and operated **Turing** on Kusama to R\&D cross-chain automation.
* **Rebrand & expansion:** In mid-2024, OAK → **Ava Protocol**, announcing an AVS on Ethereum while maintaining Polkadot roots and signaling future support paths (eventually JAM).
* **2025 transitions:** **Turing** operations paused with a **conversion path** for legacy holders to **AP** (ERC-20) as Ava consolidated onto the AVS; statements in early 2025 indicated the Polkadot parachain had not yet launched.
* **Builder implication:** Ava brings **automation know-how from Polkadot** plus **production security from EigenLayer**—a pragmatic choice for **Polkadot teams with EVM endpoints** (e.g., Moonbeam) and multi-chain products spanning EVM + Substrate.

## Key features
* **Event-driven automation:** time, oracle price, on-chain events, conditional branches.
* **Privacy & MEV defense:** TEE-backed confidentiality for logic/parameters + private submission to reduce leakage risks.
* **EigenLayer AVS security:** decentralized operators backed by restaked ETH.
* **No-code Studio:** visual canvas, templates, simulation, and dashboards.
* **Agent-ready wallets:** ERC-4337/6900 for delegated, granular permissions.
* **Composability:** EVM-first today; historical Substrate expertise; integrates with oracles, subgraphs, TEEs, and messaging layers.

> Note: **OpenZeppelin Defender** automation is slated for sunset (no new sign-ups; deprecation timeline announced), nudging teams to alternatives like Ava, Gelato, and Chainlink.

## Step-by-step: Build a private cross-chain stop-loss
**Goal:** If **wETH** drops below a threshold, **swap to USDC** on an L2 **without leaking** your trigger/size.
1. **Open Ava Protocol Studio** and connect your wallet. Start from the **Stop-Loss** template or a blank canvas.
2. **Trigger:** Add a **block-interval** or **time** trigger (e.g., every 3 minutes).
3. **Oracle read:** Pull the ETH/USDC price feed; add a **branch** to continue when price ≤ target.
4. **Action:** Call the DEX (e.g., Uniswap V3) with slippage guard; set **max gas**, **deadline**, and recipient.
5. **Privacy:** Enable **private routing** to avoid mempool exposure; ensure **TEE privacy** is on for parameters (if your flow uses confidential branches).
6. **Simulation:** Run a dry-run; check execution logs and alerts.
7. **Deploy & monitor:** Use the dashboard to watch executions, task state, gas usage, and event history.

## Common pitfalls & tips
* **Privacy ≠ just private submission:** Private routing hides TXs from the public mempool but not necessarily your **logic/parameters**. For full secrecy, combine **private submission** with **TEE-based confidentiality**.
* **Oracle drift & slippage:** Use conservative slippage + deadlines; branch on **oracle** and **pool** state where possible.
* **Finality windows:** For L2↔L1 flows, account for finality and retries.
* **Operational visibility:** Use **simulation** and **alerts** before going live; start with small sizes.
* **Ecosystem status:** Verify current **Polkadot-side** components (e.g., Turing status, parachain availability) before relying on Substrate automation.
