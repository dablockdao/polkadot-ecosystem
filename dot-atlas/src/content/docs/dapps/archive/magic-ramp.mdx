Harbour and Velocity Labs have unveiled Magic Ramp, a stablecoin payment solution that integrates SEPA Instant payment systems with the Polkadot ecosystem. This innovation heralds a new era of seamless, efficient, and cost-effective financial transactions between traditional banking systems and Web3 technology.

### **Revolutionizing Stablecoin Payments**
Magic Ramp enables users to send Euros from any SEPA-enabled bank account and receive USDC on-chain in less than 30 seconds, with minimal fees. Conversely, funds held in Web3 wallets can be swiftly transferred to bank accounts in Euros. To incentivize adoption, these transactions will be fee-free for the first six weeks post-launch. Additionally, developers can leverage virtual IBANs linked to Polkadot wallet addresses, bridging the gap between SEPA Instant payment rails and the Polkadot Asset Hub.

James Brownlee, CEO of Harbour, emphasized the significance of this integration, stating, *“Polkadot’s infrastructure enables instant, low-cost stablecoin transfers, aligning with our mission to make blockchain interoperable with traditional banking systems.”* Nicolas Arevalo, CEO of Velocity Labs, added, *“Harbour’s Magic Ramp sets a new standard by blending the convenience of on-ramps with the speed and cost-efficiency of centralized exchanges.”*

- **International Payroll and Remittances**: Providing a fast, low-cost solution for global payments.
- **Cross-Border Transactions**: Enabling frictionless movement of funds across borders and payment networks.
