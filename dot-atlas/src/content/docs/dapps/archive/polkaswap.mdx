**Polkaswap** **is a decentralized exchange (DEX) tailored for the Polkadot ecosystem**, designed to facilitate non-custodial token swapping across various blockchains seamlessly. Here are its key features:

- **Cross-Chain Swaps**: Leveraging Polkadot’s interoperability, Polkaswap allows users to swap tokens across different blockchain networks efficiently.
- **Liquidity Aggregation**: It aggregates liquidity from multiple sources to offer users competitive exchange rates and minimal slippage.
- **Non-Custodial Trading**: Polkaswap ensures that users maintain control over their assets throughout the trading process, enhancing security.
- **Automated Market Making (AMM)**: Utilizes liquidity pools and an algorithmic pricing model to enable automated and continuous trading.
- **SORA Network Integration and XOR Token**: Polkaswap is closely integrated with the SORA network, using the native XOR token for transaction fees, governance, and liquidity provision. XOR holders have significant influence over the platform’s development.

Polkaswap aims to provide a **secure, efficient, and user-friendly trading experience within the Polkadot ecosystem**, addressing the need for interoperable DeFi solutions. Despite challenges like ensuring secure cross-chain transactions and maintaining liquidity, Polkaswap is poised to make a significant impact on the DeFi and decentralized exchange landscape.
