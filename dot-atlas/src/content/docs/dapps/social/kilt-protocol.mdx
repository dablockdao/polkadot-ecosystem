## KILT Protocol: Unleash Self-Sovereign Identity on Polkadot (2025 Guide)
KILT Protocol is Polkadot’s self-sovereign identity (SSI) parachain for issuing W3C-style decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable, revocable credentials. This guide explains how KILT works, why builders choose it on Polkadot, how to ship a DID + credential flow with Sporran/web3name/DIDsign, and where KILT is used in production.

## What is KILT Protocol? (and ELI5)
KILT is a Polkadot parachain purpose-built for decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and **verifiable, revocable** credentials. Credentials are held by users, not platforms; on-chain you anchor minimal data (hashes/status), preserving privacy and enabling revocation.
**ELI5.** Imagine your wallet holds cards (driver’s license, membership). With KILT, the “cards” are digital credentials in your **Sporran** wallet; you show just what’s needed (e.g., “over 18”) while a verifier can check it’s legit—without ever copying your personal data.

## Why Polkadot? Shared security & XCM
KILT runs as a Polkadot parachain, inheriting **shared security** from the Relay Chain and gaining native cross-chain messaging (XCM) to reach other parachains/apps. This lets identity actions interoperate across the ecosystem without custom bridges.

## Core concepts
### DIDs: light vs full
* **Light DID**: created locally (off-chain), good for many uses.
* **Full (on-chain) DID**: anchored on KILT for on-chain actions (write CTypes, attestations, delegations, key rotation). Creating one requires a refundable **deposit (\~2 KILT)**, which you can reclaim by deleting the DID.

> **Note:** KILT supports DID keys for authentication, encryption, attestation, and delegation.

### CTypes, credentials, attestations & revocation
* **CTYPE**: JSON schema defining what a credential claims (e.g., *“Over-18”*).
* **Credential**: user-held data matching a CTYPE.
* **Attestation**: **hash** of the credential written on-chain by an attester; enables **revocation** and timestamping while the actual personal data stays off-chain.

### Wallet & tools: Sporran, web3name, SocialKYC, DIDsign
* **Sporran**: browser wallet for KILT coins, DIDs & credentials.
* **web3name (w3n)**: human-readable handle bound to your DID; can link addresses across KILT/Polkadot/Ethereum (via w3ndi).
* **SocialKYC**: issues credentials after you prove control of social accounts/email—privacy-preserving alternative to centralized logins.
* **DIDsign**: decentralized document/file e-signing & verification using your **on-chain DID**; supports multi-sign and timestamping.

## How KILT works (issuer–holder–verifier)
1. **Holder** requests a credential from an **Issuer/Attester** (e.g., *“age over 18”*).
2. Issuer checks evidence, creates credential for the holder, and anchors a **root hash** on KILT.
3. **Verifier** receives a presentation from the holder, checks signature + that the on-chain attestation exists and is **not revoked**.
4. If requirements change, issuer **revokes** (and can remove) the attestation on-chain.

## In the wild: production use cases
* **Deloitte (Switzerland)** – Reusable **KYC/KYB** credentials built on KILT (live since 2023), designed for banking-grade compliance while keeping user data off-chain and under user control.
* **Polimec** – Fundraising platform on Polkadot uses **reusable KYC credentials** anchored on KILT to enable compliant participation and privacy-preserving verification.
* **web3name in Nova Wallet** – Link a w3n to addresses across Polkadot, Ethereum, Bitcoin via **w3ndi** for human-readable transfers and identity.

## Mini-guide: ship a DID + credential flow
**Prereqs:** Chrome/Firefox, Sporran, small KILT balance (or Checkout Service).

1. **Install Sporran & create a light DID.**
2. **Upgrade to a full DID** (deposit ≈ 2 KILT; refundable on deletion).
3. **Claim a web3name** (requires full DID + small tx fees).
4. **Obtain a credential** (e.g., SocialKYC or enterprise issuer).
5. **Present the credential** to your app via KILT SDK; verify on-chain attestation + status.
6. (Optional) **Sign files with DIDsign** and share the signature/metadata bundle for independent verification.

**Practical example:**
*Investor onboarding on a Polkadot dApp*: Require a “KYC-Passed” credential from a recognized attester (e.g., Deloitte). Your verifier checks the user’s presentation + attestation status on KILT; store only the attestation reference and your own access decision—no personal data retained.

## Common pitfalls & tips
* **Don’t confuse light vs full DIDs.** On-chain actions (attestations, delegations, w3n) require a **full** DID (refundable deposit).
* **Linked accounts aren’t for transfers.** When linking an Ethereum account to your DID, **don’t** use that link itself for asset transfers—use the actual address.
* **Design revocation early.** Decide whether you need “mark-as-revoked” or “revoke & remove”; wire this into issuer workflows and verifier checks.
* **Minimize on-chain writes.** Keep PII off-chain; anchor only hashes/status to save fees and preserve privacy.
* **OIDC bridges.** You can place DIDs/VCs behind familiar **OpenID Connect** sign-in flows; this helps Web2 apps adopt SSI without rebuilding auth.

## FAQs
**1) Is user data stored on chain?**
No. Credentials live off-chain with the user; the chain anchors a **hash + status** (attestation) to enable verification and revocation.

**2) What’s the difference between a light and full DID?**
Light DIDs are local/off-chain; full DIDs are **anchored on KILT** and unlock on-chain actions (CTypes, attestations, delegations). Full DIDs require a refundable deposit.

**3) How do revocations work?**
The attester writes/updates **attestation status** on KILT. Verifiers check the presented credential against the on-chain attestation and its current status.

**4) Do I need KILT coins to start?**
Yes for on-chain operations (fees/deposits). For end users, **Checkout Service** can anchor a DID and let you pay with fiat while keeping keys on your device.

**5) Can I use KILT identity across Polkadot and EVM?**
Yes. web3name can link addresses across Polkadot and **Ethereum** (via w3ndi). DIDsign and credential flows are chain-agnostic from the verifier’s POV.

**6) Why build on Polkadot?**
Parachains inherit **shared security** and use **XCM** to interoperate—ideal for identity that many chains/apps must trust.

**7) Is Deloitte really using KILT?**
Yes. Deloitte Switzerland announced and shipped **reusable KYC/KYB credentials** on KILT in 2023.

**8) Can I sign PDFs/contracts with my DID?**
Yes. **DIDsign** enables decentralized signing and verification of files, including multi-sign workflows with timestamps.

## Conclusion
KILT gives builders a standards-aligned, privacy-first identity layer with **revocation**, **delegations**, and **interoperability** baked in. Running on Polkadot means shared security and easy cross-chain reach. If you’re shipping compliance-sensitive dApps (fundraising, fintech, enterprise workflows) or simply want portable identity for your users, KILT is battle-tested and ready.
