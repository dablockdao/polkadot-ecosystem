## Frequency: The DSNP L1 Blockchain on Polkadot (2025 Guide)
Frequency is a Polkadot parachain purpose-built to run the Decentralized Social Networking Protocol (DSNP), enabling portable social identities and graphs across interoperable apps. This guide explains how Frequency + DSNP work, the FRQCY + Capacity economic model, where MeWe’s large-scale migration stands, and how builders can ship DSNP-compatible apps today.

## Why Frequency + DSNP
Most social platforms lock your identity, graph, and distribution behind proprietary silos. **DSNP** standardizes the social layer (identities, relationships, announcements) so any app can interoperate. **Frequency** is the production blockchain that runs DSNP operations at scale, so users can move between apps without losing their social capital. Think “SMTP for social,” but with on-chain assurances.

## ELI5: DSNP vs “web2 social”
* **Web2:** your handle, followers, and posts stay trapped in one app.
* **DSNP on Frequency:** your **DSNP identity** + **social graph** live on shared infrastructure. Switch apps, keep your people and history.

## What Frequency is (and why Polkadot)
**Frequency** is a **Layer-1 Polkadot parachain**, built with Substrate, designed to execute DSNP operations (identity, graph, announcements). Polkadot supplies shared security and XCM interoperability; Frequency focuses on social performance and an economic model tailored for high-volume social transactions.

## Core concepts & how it works
### Identities (MSA)
* **Message Source Account (MSA):** the on-chain identity tied to a DSNP User ID.
* Stores delegation relationships and schema permissions; manages profile/graph state.

### Providers & Delegation
* Users can **delegate** posting/management rights to **Providers** (e.g., apps or services) and selectively grant schema permissions—useful for “coinless” UX where apps sponsor interactions.

### Announcements, Schemas & Messages
* DSNP defines **Announcements** (posts, follows, etc.) mapped to **Schemas**.
* Frequency’s **Messages** pallet stores announcements or **Batch Publications** to scale throughput efficiently.

### Operations (extrinsics)
* DSNP operations are executed via **Substrate extrinsics** exposed by pallets: MSA (identity), Messages (announcements), Schema (data types), and stateful storage primitives.

### Identity enrichment (optional)
* Projects can enrich identities with **KILT DIDs** to bind verifiable credentials to DSNP identities where needed (KYC, age attestations, etc.).

## Tokenomics: FRQCY & “Capacity”
* **FRQCY** is Frequency’s utility token. Fees for general transactions are paid in FRQCY (XRQCY on testnets).
* Frequency also offers **Capacity**—a renewing, stake-based allowance so **Providers** can perform certain DSNP transactions without per-tx fees. Capacity accrues based on **staked FRQCY**; the ratio is governed on-chain and resets each **Capacity epoch**.
* **Design goal:** combine a standard fee market with staking-based throughput for app-sponsored, “coinless” UX at scale and predictable cost profiles.

> **Why this matters:** For social networking, cost predictability and sponsorship are key. Capacity lets a Provider pre-commit to throughput, then batch and publish posts/graphs efficiently.

## Real-world adoption: MeWe’s migration
**MeWe** (20M+ users) began integrating DSNP on Frequency in 2023, publicizing milestones such as:

* The “largest migration to decentralized social” initiative (late 2023).
* 500k active users migrated to Web3 via Frequency (early 2024).
* 1M+ users on-chain milestones reported through 2024–2025, with hundreds of thousands owning their social graph.

These milestones demonstrate DSNP/Frequency at consumer scale—not just a lab demo.

## Architecture: Where data lives
* **On-chain (Frequency):** identities (MSAs), delegations, graph/state pointers, announcement commitments, and batched publications per DSNP schemas.
* **Off-chain (app infra):** rich media/content blobs can be pinned elsewhere (e.g., app CDN or decentralized storage) and referenced from DSNP announcements.

## Build on Frequency: step-by-step
### A. Plan your UX & identity
1. Decide if users sign directly or delegate to your **Provider** (recommended for mass-market).
2. (Optional) Integrate **KILT DIDs** for credential-based features (age-gating, verified creators).

### B. Wire DSNP primitives
3. Create **MSAs** and set **delegations/permissions** to your Provider for the schemas you’ll use.
4. Choose your **Schemas** (posts, follows, profiles); map UI actions to DSNP **Announcements**.

### C. Publish efficiently
5. Use **Batch Publications** whenever possible to aggregate many posts/follows in one operation.
6. Decide what goes **on-chain** vs **off-chain** (e.g., store text + pointers on-chain; media off-chain).

### D. Economics & ops
7. Stake **FRQCY** to earn **Capacity** proportional to your expected DSNP throughput; monitor the epoch schedule and governance-set ratios.
8. For bursts, fall back to paying FRQCY fees; keep a treasury wallet topped up.

### E. Interop & compliance
9. Expose export/import tools for DSNP handles & graphs to honor portability.
10. If you need cross-chain assets or bridges (e.g., rewards), lean on Polkadot/XCM patterns from the broader ecosystem.

**Practical example — a Twitter-like feed:**

* User signs into your app → Provider holds a delegated key.
* User posts → your service composes a DSNP **Announcement** and batches with others.
* A single **Batch Publication** writes it to Frequency, emitting events your indexer subscribes to.
* Any DSNP-aware client can render that post alongside the user’s existing graph.

## Common pitfalls & tips
* **Forgetting delegation scope:** grant only the schemas your Provider needs; over-broad permissions are a risk.
* **Not batching:** costs + latency spike if you publish every announcement individually. Batch by default.
* **Capacity sizing:** under-staking leads to throttling; model daily/weekly peaks and stake FRQCY accordingly.
* **Identity collisions:** if you add DIDs, store bindings carefully and surface revocation UX.
* **Spec drift:** track DSNP spec updates and Frequency runtime changes for pallet/extrinsic updates.

## FAQs
**1) Is there a token?**
Yes. **FRQCY** is Frequency’s native utility token for fees; **Capacity** is a renewing, stake-based allowance for certain transactions.

**2) Do end-users need tokens?**
Not necessarily. Apps can operate as **Providers**, stake FRQCY to earn **Capacity**, and sponsor UX—so users can post without holding tokens.

**3) What exactly is DSNP?**
An open protocol that standardizes identities, graphs, and announcement formats so apps interoperate. It’s app-agnostic—akin to SMTP/HTTP for social.

**4) Where are posts stored?**
Announcements are committed/published on-chain (with batch options); media can live off-chain and be referenced.

**5) Can I enrich DSNP identities with verifiable credentials?**
Yes; use a DID system such as **KILT** to attach attestations.

**6) Is anyone big using it?**
**MeWe** has publicly announced and shipped milestones indicating hundreds of thousands of users migrated to DSNP on Frequency, with over a million on-chain events reported through 2024–2025.

**7) Why Polkadot?**
Parachains get shared security and native interop (XCM), letting Frequency focus on DSNP scale and economics.

**8) Is this financial advice?**
No—this article is educational, not investment advice.

## Conclusion
Frequency operationalizes DSNP on a production L1, giving builders portable identities, programmable graphs, and predictable posting economics via FRQCY + Capacity. If you’re shipping social apps (consumer or enterprise), start by mapping your UI to DSNP schemas, decide on Provider-backed UX, and size your Capacity so you can batch efficiently. **Ready to build?** Map your features to DSNP operations, stand up your Provider, and ship your first Batch Publication.
