# MeWe & Polkadot: How DSNP + Frequency Bring Web2 Social to Web3 (2025 Guide)
This guide explains what **MeWe** is doing with **Polkadot**, why **DSNP** and the **Frequency** parachain matter, and how users/devs can onboard to Web3 social—without needing crypto. We cover the architecture, timelines, comparisons to Lens/Farcaster/ActivityPub/AT Protocol, and practical steps.

## Why this matters (problem → benefit)
**Problem:** Social networks lock your identity and social graph inside siloed databases. If a platform changes policy, you lose reach, portability, and control.

**Benefit:** With **Polkadot’s Frequency parachain** and **DSNP (Decentralized Social Networking Protocol)**, **MeWe** is moving users toward **self-sovereign social identities** and **portable social graphs**. That means you can keep your handle and relationships across compatible apps—**without needing to buy tokens** or learn DeFi.

## ELI5: MeWe × Polkadot in one minute
* **MeWe** = privacy-centric social app (tens of millions of accounts).
* **DSNP** = open protocol for portable social identities & feeds.
* **Frequency** = a **Polkadot parachain** purpose-built to run DSNP at scale.
* Together, they let MeWe users **opt in** to a **Web3 handle** and **own their social graph**, while MeWe’s UX stays familiar (no crypto required).

## How it works: DSNP + Frequency + MeWe

### At a glance
* **DSNP** defines how social actions are represented and broadcast. Announcements (e.g., posts, profile updates) are **anchored on-chain** and **link to content stored off-chain**, forming a verifiable chain of trust from identity → activity.
* **Frequency** runs DSNP at scale as a **Polkadot parachain**, providing throughput and shared security. Apps like MeWe can leverage **DSNP + Frequency** for identity and graph portability while keeping familiar UI.
* **MeWe** onboards users with an **opt-in Web3 flow** (choose a **Universal Handle**; keep using the app as normal). You **don’t need to buy crypto**, and you can continue using MeWe without Web3 enabled.

### Deeper dive
* **Identity & handles:** Users get a DSNP/Frequency handle (portable identifier). Your social graph (follows, followers) can be encoded so other DSNP-compatible apps can read it—preserving relationships across apps.
* **Data model:** DSNP models **broadcast announcements** on a consensus system with **links to off-chain content** (e.g., object storage). This reduces costs and keeps feeds fast while retaining cryptographic verifiability.
* **Why Polkadot:** Frequency is a parachain on Polkadot—benefiting from shared security and interoperability. A dedicated chain for social helps meet latency/scale needs for mainstream apps.

## What’s happened so far (timeline)
* **Sep 2022:** Public announcements of **MeWe → DSNP** integration plans.
* **Apr 2023:** MeWe adopts **Frequency (Polkadot)** to bring self-sovereign identity to a large user base.
* **Nov 2023:** Reports of \~**170k** active users on Web3 post-integration.
* **Jan 2024:** \~**500k** active users migrated—at the time, among the largest Web2→Web3 social migrations.
* **Aug 2024:** Frequency celebrates **1M+ on-chain users** with MeWe.
* **Early 2025:** Public posts claim **1.4M+** users migrated.
* **2025 context:** Numbers vary by source and timeframe; expect continued iteration on features and reporting.

> **Note:** MeWe has also publicized collaborations with other chains for specific app features. Its **identity & social graph migration** is anchored via **DSNP on Polkadot’s Frequency**. Always verify the latest statements for scope and metrics.

## Key features & benefits
* **User-owned identity & graph:** Keep your handle and relationships across DSNP-aware apps.
* **No crypto required for users:** MeWe’s UX doesn’t force wallets/tokens for basic use.
* **Scalability for social:** Frequency specializes in high-volume announcements; content stays off-chain with on-chain anchors.
* **Interoperability:** Built on Polkadot—parachain model, shared security, potential future XCM integrations.
* **Developer friendly:** Open protocol (DSNP) with clear primitives (announcements, identities, feeds).

## Step-by-step: Claiming a MeWe Web3 identity & building with DSNP

### For MeWe users (no crypto needed)
1. **Open MeWe** → look for the **Web3 / Social Web** prompt.
2. **Opt-in** to migration; **choose a Universal Handle** (suffix ensures uniqueness).
3. **Continue using MeWe** normally; your identity/graph can now be portable to DSNP-compatible apps.
4. **Security tip:** Save recovery info and enable 2FA where offered.

### For developers (quick start)
1. **Learn DSNP basics:** Announcements, Identifiers, Graph.
2. **Model your app** around DSNP **Announcements** (Broadcast, Reply, Update) with off-chain content + on-chain anchors.
3. **Integrate Frequency** (submit announcements; verify identities/handles). Start with public endpoints/SDKs where available.
4. **User onboarding:** Mirror MeWe’s approach—**no wallet required** for basic flows; abstract keys where possible.
5. **Interop testing:** Validate read/write with other DSNP clients; test profile/graph portability.

## Common pitfalls & pro tips

* **Assuming content is “fully on-chain.”** DSNP anchors events on-chain but links to off-chain content for scale. Design storage accordingly.
* **Handle collisions/UX:** DSNP handles may include **suffixes**; communicate this clearly to users.
* **Governance & moderation:** Protocols don’t remove the need for app-level policies. Plan moderation/abuse tooling (labeling, filtering, reporting).
* **Multi-chain headlines ≠ identity migration.** MeWe’s identity/graph migration leverages **DSNP on Frequency (Polkadot)**; other chain partnerships may target different app features. Clarify scope in your messaging.

## FAQs
**1) Do I need DOT or any crypto to use MeWe’s Web3 features?**
No. Web3 is opt-in; you can use MeWe without buying crypto.

**2) What exactly is DSNP?**
An **open protocol** for social identities/feeds designed for **portability** and verifiable announcements.

**3) What’s Frequency’s role and how is Polkadot involved?**
Frequency is a **Polkadot parachain** purpose-built to run DSNP at scale—anchoring announcements and identities while apps keep familiar UX.

**4) How many MeWe users have migrated?**
Public figures evolved over time (e.g., hundreds of thousands of active users migrated; seven-figure on-chain counts). Exact numbers vary by source and date.

**5) How is this different from Mastodon/ActivityPub?**
ActivityPub is a **W3C protocol** (no blockchain). DSNP adds **on-chain announcements** and standardized portability via a specialized chain (Frequency).

**6) How does this compare to Farcaster or Lens?**
Farcaster keeps **identity on an EVM L2** with content via **Hubs**; Lens moved to a **dedicated chain** with a data-availability layer. DSNP/Frequency emphasizes **portable identities + on-chain announcements** for scale.

**7) Can I take my MeWe identity to other apps?**
Yes—DSNP’s goal is portability of identity and graph across compatible apps. Availability depends on the target app’s DSNP support.

**8) Is this investment advice about DOT or any token?**
No—this guide is educational. **Not financial advice.**

## Conclusion
**MeWe’s DSNP + Frequency path on Polkadot** shows a credible route from Web2 scale to Web3 portability—**without forcing tokens on users**. If you’re a **builder**, start modeling your social actions as **DSNP announcements** and plug into **Frequency**. If you’re a **community or brand**, claim your **Universal Handle** and future-proof your audience portability.
