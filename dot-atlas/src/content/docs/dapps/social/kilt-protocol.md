KILT Protocol empowers individuals and organizations to manage their digital identities and control their data within the Polkadot ecosystem. 
- A blockchain protocol built on Polkadot for self-sovereign data and interoperability.
- Enables users to create and manage decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to represent their digital identities.
- Allows trusted entities (Attesters) to issue verifiable credentials (VCs) that attest to user attributes.

## Kilt Protocol Key Features:
- **Self-Sovereign Identity:** Users control their DIDs and decide what data to share with whom.
- **Revocable Credentials:** Attesters can revoke credentials if necessary, ensuring data integrity.
- **Secure and Private:** TEE technology safeguards sensitive information during credential issuance and verification.
- **Trust Marketplace:** Attesters can be compensated for issuing trusted credentials.

### Benefits:
- **Empowers Users:** Individuals gain control over their digital identities and data.
- **Enhanced Security:** TEE protects sensitive data during credential processing.
- **Streamlined Trust Management:** Reduces reliance on centralized authorities for identity verification.
- **New Business Models:** Enables businesses to build on trust infrastructure for innovative applications.

### Components:
- **DIDs:** Unique identifiers for entities on the KILT blockchain.
- **Verifiable Credentials (VCs):** Issued by Attesters to certify user attributes.
- **Attesters:** Trusted entities authorized to issue VCs.
- **KILT Token (KILT):** Used for network fees, resource allocation, and staking within the KILT ecosystem.

## Kilt Protocol - How it Works:
- **User Creates DID:** A user creates a DID on the KILT blockchain to represent their digital identity.
- **Request Credential:** The user requests a credential from a trusted Attester for a specific attribute.
- **Attester Issues VC:** The Attester verifies the claim and issues a VC if satisfied.  
  User Presents VC: The user selectively presents relevant information from the VC to a Verifier.
- **Verifier Checks Authenticity:** The Verifier confirms the VC’s authenticity and trusts the Attester.

## KILT vs. Centralized Identity Management:
- KILT eliminates the need for centralized authorities, giving users control over their data.
- Revocable credentials ensure data accuracy and prevent misuse.
- Secure enclaves protect sensitive information during credential processing.

## Incorporating KILT into Polkadot Dapps:
KILT offers a unique solution for dapps requiring secure and user-controlled identity management. By integrating KILT, developers can build trust-based applications that empower users and unlock new possibilities within the Polkadot ecosystem.
