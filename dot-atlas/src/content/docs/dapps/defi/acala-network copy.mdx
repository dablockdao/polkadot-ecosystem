**Acala is a full-stack decentralized finance (DeFi) platform on Polkadot**, offering a complete suite of financial services to the ecosystem for improved interoperability, stability, and liquidity.

## Key points on Acala:
1. **Decentralized Exchange (DEX):** Features one of the best DEX in the industry, with a built-in DinanceX that seamlessly supports asset exchanges, including cross-chain assets, with high liquidity and a minimum slippage for many trading pairs.
2. **Liquid Staking:** Liquid staking through Liquid DOT (LDOT), whereby the staker will have his DOT tokens liquidity enabled and still be in a position to reap all staking benefits, would be more friendly in the sense of allowing the use of the staked assets in DeFi applications.
3. **Full compatibility with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM):** It supports hosting, thus allowing developers for Ethereum to easily deploy their smart contracts and dApps on Acala with an integrated set of cross-blockchain financial and DeFi services.
4. **Empowerment through Decentralized Governance:** Empower the token holders with the rights to vote into the governance process, allowing community influence toward the development of Acala to make sure it’s aligned with users’ interests.
5. **<del>Acala Dollar (aUSD):</del>** The decentralized stablecoin pegged at 1:1 with the US dollar and designed as a stable medium of exchange, stable store of value, and unit of account in the Polkadot ecosystem. 
  - After the incident with aUSD that caused it to lose parity with the USD, **this project has not been continued by the Acala Network team**.
