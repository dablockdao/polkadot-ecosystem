Starfish Finance is an innovative DeFi platform incubated with the Astar Network Program, designed to offer a multi-chain, one-stop DeFi and Entertainment-Fi experience primarily on Arbitrum One and Astar Network. The platform incorporates gamification to deliver an entertainment-rich DeFi experience, merging NFTs for decentralized financing and providing a unique user experience.

**Vision and Product Suite** Starfish Finance is on a journey to become the top Web3 Entertainment-Fi brand, building on a robust DeFi technological foundation while expanding into gamified features across the Astar Network, Arbitrum, and additional ecosystems. It engages the community with “SEAN Times,” a weekly newsletter that provides insights from Starfish leadership.

**Key Features**

1. **Swap (Astar Network)**: Allows users to trade tokens and stablecoins across multi-token pools.
2. **Liquidity (Astar Network)**: Users can provide liquidity or create pools with up to eight tokens, sharing in the trading fees.
3. **Farm (Astar Network)**: Offers the opportunity for users to stake Liquidity Pool Tokens in farms to earn bonus rewards.
4. **Stake (Astar Network)**: Enables staking of SEAN tokens to earn USDC stablecoin as part of the protocol revenue from trading. Staking SEAN also provides access to the upcoming Seabed Launch.
5. **DOT Liquid Staking (Astar Network)**: Facilitates DOT staking to earn sDOT and rewards, enhancing liquidity in the ecosystem.

**Brand Values and Personality** Starfish Finance promotes values of community, collaboration, and convenience, aiming to provide a multi-chain future that offers a gamified DeFi and NFT experience. At its core, SEAN, a friendly entity from Starfish Planet, symbolizes inclusivity, connectivity, and a passion for crypto and NFT trading.

**Strategic Goals** Starfish Finance utilizes the Astar Builders program to construct a next-generation **DeFi x NFT-Fi headquarters within the Polkadot ecosystem**. This initiative aims to deepen the liquidity of crypto and NFT trading and financing through stablecoin swaps and NFT-Fi, based on an enhanced Balancer AMM model. Starfish Finance invites users to a comprehensive platform where they can engage in swapping, liquidity provision, staking, farming, launching, and exploring NFT-Fi, all under one roof.

This fully integrated, highly accessible platform promises a unique DeFi x NFT-Fi financing experience, underscored by the platform’s commitment to a multi-chain future and **gamified DeFi interactions**.
