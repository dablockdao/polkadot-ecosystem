Hydration is Polkadot’s DeFi appchain that unifies **swaps (Omnipool)**, **lending/borrowing (Aave-v3–style money market)**, and **HOLLAR**, an over-collateralized stablecoin—plus a cross-chain swap UX that abstracts XCM under the hood. This guide distills how Hydration works, when to use each product, and how to execute a remote swap from DOT to USDT on Asset Hub in a few steps.

## Why Hydration matters now

Polkadot’s modular architecture puts assets across **Asset Hub** and many parachains. Hydration simplifies this by concentrating liquidity in the **Omnipool**, providing a **money market**, and introducing **HOLLAR** for a native, over-collateralized unit of account—all on a single DeFi appchain that leverages XCM for cross-chain settlement. For users and DAOs, that means fewer tabs, fewer bridges, and fewer foot-guns.

> **Context (Sept 2025):** Hydration evolved from HydraDX, rebranding as the network expanded from trading into lending and a native stablecoin.

## ELI5: Hydration in one minute

* **One appchain, three pillars:** **Trade** in one big pool, **borrow/lend** like Aave v3, **mint/use HOLLAR** against crypto collateral.
* **Liquidity lives together:** The **Omnipool** holds many assets in a single pool so routes are shorter and slippage is reduced.
* **Cross-chain without the pain:** “Remote swaps” package XCM steps so you can end with the asset **where you want it** (e.g., USDT on Asset Hub) in one flow.

## How Hydration works

### 1) Omnipool trading

The **Hydration Omnipool** is a novel AMM concentrating multi-asset liquidity in one pool. Instead of hopping pool-to-pool, most trades route internally, improving capital efficiency and depth. Mathematical specs and risk controls (caps, fees, circuit breakers) underpin the design.

**Who benefits**

* **Traders:** Tighter pricing on long-tail pairs via single-pool routing.
* **Projects/DAOs:** One venue to deepen liquidity and set **DAO-approved** listings via on-chain governance.

### 2) Lending & borrowing

Hydration runs a fork of **Aave v3** to supply assets, earn yield, and borrow against collateral. This integrates naturally with trading and HOLLAR use cases (e.g., mint stablecoin, hedge, or lever up).

### 3) HOLLAR stablecoin

**HOLLAR** is Hydration’s **over-collateralized** stablecoin targeting ≈\$1, minted against crypto collateral. It is *not* algorithmic; every HOLLAR is backed by deposited assets in the system, with risk parameters and liquidations as guardrails.

### 4) Cross-chain swaps (“remote swaps”)

Hydration’s developer docs describe **remote swaps** that compose XCM instructions so a user can, for example, swap **DOT on the Relay Chain** into **USDT on Asset Hub** in one UX flow. The app crafts the needed XCM under the hood, handling reserve locations and final destinations.

## Hydration App on Polkadot: Key features at a glance

* **Unified DeFi appchain:** trading, lending, and a native stablecoin on Polkadot.
* **Single-pool liquidity model (Omnipool):** efficient routing, fewer hops, governance-gated listings.
* **Aave-v3–style money market:** supply/borrow with risk tooling derived from a proven framework.
* **Over-collateralized stablecoin (HOLLAR):** crypto-backed, protocol-native, and designed for composable use in swaps, lending, or treasuries.
* **Cross-chain UX:** package XCM so users end with the asset on the **right chain** (e.g., Asset Hub).

## HDX Token: The Governance Engine of Hydration DAO

**HDX** is Hydration’s native governance and incentive token: holding HDX grants you voting power in the **Hydration DAO**, which decides on protocol changes—including whether a project’s asset is listed in the Omnipool via public referenda of HDX holders. Beyond governance, HDX helps align behavior across the appchain by **redistributing protocol revenue** to participants who take beneficial actions (e.g., liquidity provision or other DAO-defined activities), reinforcing sustainable liquidity and risk management. Historically, HDX distribution included an LBP phase with **xHDX** claims, and the token has continued to anchor the project’s evolution from **HydraDX** to **Hydration** under on-chain mandates.

## Mini-guide: DOT → USDT on Asset Hub via Hydration

**Goal:** End with **USDT on Asset Hub** starting from **DOT**.

1. **Connect wallet** to Hydration App (e.g., Talisman/Polkadot.js/Nova).
2. **Choose source asset & origin**: DOT (Relay Chain).
3. **Choose destination asset & chain**: USDT (Asset Hub).
4. **Review route & fees**: The UI composes a **remote swap** that trades DOT and delivers USDT to Asset Hub in one flow.
5. **Sign once**: Approve the batched XCM.
6. **Verify settlement** on Asset Hub (explorer/wallet).

> Tip: If you’re moving from CEX → Asset Hub → Hydration, you can also use the **Cross-Chain** page in Hydration’s app and supported wallets (e.g., Talisman, Nova).

## Practical example: Treasury DCA & liquidity routing

Public proposals have described using Hydration’s **rolling DCA** to diversify the Polkadot Treasury into **tBTC**, and then deploying liquidity back into the Omnipool to support ecosystem pairs. The workflow shows how treasuries can combine **DCA**, **Omnipool LP**, and **cross-chain settlement** in practice.

## Common pitfalls & pro tips

* **Reserve location matters:** XCM behavior depends on where an asset’s **reserve** lives (Relay Chain, Asset Hub, or a parachain). Hydration’s remote swaps handle this, but advanced users should still understand reserve chains to predict fees/weights.
* **DAO listings ≠ automatic:** Tokens list in the Omnipool only after **Hydration DAO** approval through referenda—even if criteria are met. Plan lead time for governance.
* **Stablecoin is collateralized:** **HOLLAR** is *not* algorithmic; treat it like a Maker-style crypto-backed stablecoin with collateral/liq. limits. Watch health factors when borrowing.
* **Money-market risks:** Aave v3-derived designs are battle-tested but not risk-free. Monitor interest rate spikes, collateral factors, and liquidation thresholds.
* **Cross-chain fees & confirmations:** Remote swaps abstract XCM, but you still incur **execution fees** and should verify final balances on the destination chain.

## FAQs

**1) What’s the simplest mental model for Hydration?**
A **DeFi hub** on Polkadot that merges **trading**, **lending**, and a **stablecoin** under one chain and UI.

**2) How is the Omnipool different from standard DEX pools?**
It’s a **single multi-asset pool** (not fragmented pairs), so most routes are internal, improving efficiency and depth.

**3) Is HOLLAR algorithmic?**
No. It is **over-collateralized** and minted against crypto collateral with liquidations.

**4) What powers Hydration’s lending?**
A fork of **Aave v3** with risk parameters and interest rate models suited to Hydration’s asset set.

**5) Can I end a swap on Asset Hub or another parachain?**
Yes. The **remote swap** flow composes XCM so you receive the asset on the destination chain (e.g., USDT on Asset Hub).

**6) Who decides which tokens list in the Omnipool?**
**Hydration DAO** via on-chain referenda of **HDX** holders; listings can be declined even if guidelines are met.

**7) Where does Asset Hub fit in?**
Asset Hub is Polkadot’s system chain for issuing/holding assets and is a common landing zone for stablecoins like **USDT** in cross-chain flows.

**8) Is this investment advice?**
No. This is **educational** information about protocol mechanics and UX.

## Strategies: GDOT (GIGADOT) & GETH (GIGAETH)
**Quick primer.**
**GDOT** and **GETH** are Hydration “strategy tokens” that *bundle multiple yield sources into a single asset* while keeping exposure to **DOT** and **ETH**, respectively.

* **GDOT** blends: DOT staking yield via **vDOT**, lending yield via **aDOT**, plus liquidity/trading incentives available on Hydration. It can also be used as **collateral** in Hydration Borrow.
* **GETH** blends: ETH staking yield via **wstETH**, lending yield via **aETH**, and fees/incentives from the **wstETH–aETH** pool; it’s designed to be **collateralizable** and LP-able on Hydration.

### Core plays (for power users & treasuries)

* **Hold for composite yield.** Simply holding GDOT/GETH accrues the packaged yields from their underlying components—no active juggling across staking, lending, and LPs.
* **Use as collateral; borrow stable liquidity.** Post GDOT/GETH as collateral in **Hydration Borrow** to draw **HOLLAR** (or other supported assets), funding operations or strategies *without selling* your DOT/ETH exposure. Monitor **health factor** and liquidation thresholds.
* **LP & farm when incentives are attractive.** Supply GDOT/GETH liquidity (single-sided via Omnipool or configured pools) to capture trading fees and programmatic incentives when active.
* **Route cross-chain outcomes.** After borrowing or swapping, use Hydration’s remote-swap UX to deliver assets (e.g., USDT) to **Asset Hub** or another parachain—reducing manual XCM steps.

### Three practical strategy templates

**1) “Set-and-sip” yield stack (no leverage)**

* Acquire **GDOT** (for DOT exposure) or **GETH** (for ETH exposure).
* Hold to auto-accrue the blended staking + lending + LP incentives; optionally allocate a small slice to LPs when APRs are attractive.
* Rebalance quarterly; treat as a *consolidated yield sleeve* in a Polkadot treasury.

**2) Collateralized HOLLAR runway (conservative)**

* Deposit **GDOT** or **GETH** as **collateral** in Hydration Borrow.
* Borrow **HOLLAR** against it to cover operating spend, market-making quotes, or controlled DCA into target assets.
* Keep **HF ≥ 1.8–2.0** (illustrative) and set alerts; repay with operating flows or periodic swaps.

**3) Yield-compounding loop (advanced, risk-on)**

* For DOT: loop with **vDOT** exposure inside **GDOT**—post GDOT as collateral, borrow DOT/HOLLAR, re-enter GDOT or vDOT until marginal APR ≈ borrow cost + risk premium.
* For ETH: similar loop using **GETH** collateral; note GETH’s stack (wstETH + aETH + pool fees) and watch pool peg dynamics.
* This accelerates APY but tightens liquidation bands; model adverse moves and peg slippage before sizing.

### Implementation notes & checkpoints

* **Whitelists/params.** Confirm GDOT/GETH are **enabled as collateral** and check current LTVs, liquidation thresholds, and borrow APRs in-app before executing.
* **ETH stack specifics.** The **wstETH–aETH** stableswap and **aETH** interest leg are integral to GETH’s blend; governance referenda configured these components (including peg update bounds) when enabling GIGAETH and related pools.
* **Incentive windows.** Hydration has run **GIGAHydration** campaigns (e.g., extra **GDOT** farms) that temporarily boost returns—use, but don’t overfit your strategy to expiring boosts.

### Risk & ops checklist (read before sizing)

* **Composite risk.** GDOT/GETH inherit risk from all legs (staking derivatives, lending markets, LP pools) and smart-contract/governance changes. Size accordingly.
* **Collateral health.** Borrowing against strategy tokens compounds volatility; keep buffers, set alerts, and understand **health factor** math.
* **Peg/path dependencies.** GETH relies on **wstETH–aETH** mechanics; extreme market conditions can widen spreads or impact rebalance costs. Governance parameters (e.g., max peg update) exist but do not eliminate basis risk.
* **Incentive decay.** Boost programs (e.g., GDOT farms) are transient; ensure your base carry still clears funding costs post-incentives.

> **Heads-up:** Nothing here is investment advice. Treat GDOT/GETH as *tools* to package multiple yield streams; model worst-case scenarios (rate spikes, collateral haircuts, peg moves) before deploying treasury-scale capital.


## Conclusion
Hydration collapses DeFi complexity on Polkadot into one coherent hub: **Omnipool** for depth and routing, **lending** for capital efficiency, **HOLLAR** for a native, collateralized unit of account, and **remote swaps** to put the right asset on the right chain. For power users, treasuries, and DAOs, it’s a pragmatic way to trade, route, borrow, and settle across Polkadot with fewer steps.
