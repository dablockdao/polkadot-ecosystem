**Acala is a full-stack decentralized finance (DeFi) platform on Polkadot**, offering a complete suite of financial services to the ecosystem for improved interoperability, stability, and liquidity.

## Key points on Acala:
1. **Decentralized Exchange (DEX):** Features one of the best DEX in the industry, with a built-in DinanceX that seamlessly supports asset exchanges, including cross-chain assets, with high liquidity and a minimum slippage for many trading pairs.
2. **Liquid Staking:** Liquid staking through Liquid DOT (LDOT), whereby the staker will have his DOT tokens liquidity enabled and still be in a position to reap all staking benefits, would be more friendly in the sense of allowing the use of the staked assets in DeFi applications.
3. **Full compatibility with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM):** It supports hosting, thus allowing developers for Ethereum to easily deploy their smart contracts and dApps on Acala with an integrated set of cross-blockchain financial and DeFi services.
4. **Empowerment through Decentralized Governance:** Empower the token holders with the rights to vote into the governance process, allowing community influence toward the development of Acala to make sure it’s aligned with users’ interests.
5. **<del>Acala Dollar (aUSD):</del>** The decentralized stablecoin pegged at 1:1 with the US dollar and designed as a stable medium of exchange, stable store of value, and unit of account in the Polkadot ecosystem. 
  - After the incident with aUSD that caused it to lose parity with the USD, this project has not been continued by the Acala Network team.
It envisages an **open, scalable, and interoperable Acala DeFi environment** within the Polkadot ecosystem that provides solutions to the two critical DeFi challenges, which are price stability and asset liquidity. Acala is the DeFi platform at the foundation level in the Polkadot platform and sits as a key part of how decentralized finance will be envisaged in the future.
