The Polkadot Collectives are a critical evolution within the Polkadot ecosystem, designed to foster collaboration and decentralization on a broader scale. 
These specialized governance groups enable communities to come together with shared goals, whether through creating decentralized organizations (DAOs), funding initiatives, or coordinating large-scale projects.

## Polkadot Collectives: How the Fellowship & Alliance Supercharge OpenGov

Polkadot Collectives are on-chain organizations hosted on the **Collectives system parachain**. Today, the two headline collectives—the **Polkadot Technical Fellowship** and the **Polkadot Alliance**—provide expert stewardship and ecosystem standards that complement OpenGov, enabling safer upgrades, faster incident response, and coordinated community action. Updated **September 2025**.

## What are Polkadot Collectives? (ELI5)
Think of **Collectives** as *specialized on-chain groups* dedicated to the long-term health of Polkadot. They live on the **Collectives system chain** and maintain their own membership rules, ranks, and governance processes. Today, the chain hosts the **Technical Fellowship** (expert engineers) and the **Polkadot Alliance** (ecosystem standards & anti-abuse).

> **Key fact:** The Collectives system parachain was added to Polkadot via **Referendum 81** and exists **only on Polkadot** (no Kusama equivalent).

## Why this matters for builders & governors
* **Safer upgrades:** The Fellowship can whitelist time-critical, low-risk technical proposals using the **Whitelisted Caller** origin/track, allowing faster enactment than Root when appropriate.
* **Ecosystem integrity:** The Alliance coordinates projects around shared standards, recognition of good actors, and surfacing of bad practices—reducing user risk and reputational drag.
* **Clear separation of concerns:** Token-holder OpenGov keeps the final say for broad governance, while collectives supply expert review and codified norms that improve decision quality.

## Landscape at a glance
* **System chain:** *Collectives* (host environment for collective logic, membership, ranks).
* **Active collectives:**
  * **Polkadot Technical Fellowship** — ranked individual experts who steward technical safety & upgrades.
  * **Polkadot Alliance** — organization-level body promoting standards and exposing misconduct; founded by **Acala, Astar, Interlay, KILT, Moonbeam, Phala, Subscan**.
* **Data visibility:** Collectives activity is queryable on public analytics dashboards.

## How the Collectives parachain works
**Collectives** is a **system parachain** owned by the network (DOT holders via OpenGov), like Asset Hub or Bridge Hub. It provides runtime pallets for collective membership, ranks, proposals, and actions. New collectives can be added through governance if/when the ecosystem needs them.

**OpenGov interplay:**
* The **Fellowship** can authorize the **Whitelisted Caller** origin to execute pre-vetted calls with Root-level privileges under stricter constraints (scope, timing), enabling *expedited yet safer* technical enactments.
* Tracks and parameters differ from Root to reduce time-to-fix for neutral technical changes (e.g., runtime upgrades).

## Collective profiles

### Polkadot Technical Fellowship
A rules-based, ranked membership of individual experts stewarding Polkadot’s technical direction and safety. Ranks (0–9) determine voting weight and responsibilities; higher ranks review/approve **whitelisted** technical actions. The Fellowship replaced Governance V1’s Technical Committee with a more scalable, merit-based structure.

**What it does**
* Reviews RFCs, runtime changes, and *time-critical* fixes for safety.
* Votes to authorize **Whitelisted Caller** for eligible proposals.
* Applies rank-weighted voting for internal decisions.

**Why builders care**
* Reduced friction for **neutral** technical upgrades that shouldn’t wait through full Root timelines.
* Public process documented via community portals and dashboards; better predictability for release trains.

**Joining**
* Individuals can apply and progress ranks via evidence of contributions; the process uses on-chain referenda within the collective and rank-based voting.

### Polkadot Alliance
An on-chain consortium of projects that codifies **ecosystem standards**, recognizes positive contributors, and surfaces bad actors or anti-user behavior. It was **seeded by seven founding members** (Acala, Astar, Interlay, KILT, Moonbeam, Phala, Subscan) and operates with roles such as *Fellows* and *Allies*.

**What it does**
* Establishes shared norms for open-source conduct and brand integrity.
* Coordinates responses to ecosystem-wide abuse patterns in collaboration with community safety efforts.

**Why builders care**
* Clear guidance on acceptable practices for listings, claims, and code reuse.
* Reputation benefits for Alliance members when engaging users and partners.

## Collectives vs OpenGov & Treasury: who does what?

## Mini-guide: engaging with a collective
1. **Map your intent.**
   * *Technical change?* Start with the **Fellowship** process (RFC, review, potential whitelist).
   * *Ecosystem standards/recognition?* Engage the **Alliance**.

2. **Prepare evidence.**
   * For Fellowship: link PRs, audits, reproducible test vectors, and an impact/risk brief aligned to neutral, low-risk change criteria.
   * For Alliance: show consistent open-source conduct, community service, and conformance with ecosystem norms.

3. **Use the right venue.**
   * **RFC & technical review** via the Fellowship’s documented process and discussion interfaces.
   * **Alliance membership / actions** via the Alliance’s documented process and community threads.

4. **Align with OpenGov timelines.**
   * If whitelisting is appropriate, coordinate the **Whitelisted Caller** track for expedited enactment; otherwise follow Root.

5. **Communicate and monitor.**
   * Share rationale, risk bounds, and testing results; monitor chain activity after enactment.

## Practical example: fast-tracking a critical runtime fix
* **Scenario:** A parachain-wide bug is discovered; a minimal patch is ready.
* **Path:** Team drafts an RFC + risk assessment → Fellowship review → **Whitelisted Caller** authorization for the call → OpenGov referendum on the Whitelisted Caller track → expedited enactment if approved.
* **Outcome:** Safe, timely upgrade without bypassing checks or overusing Root authority.

## FAQs
**1) What lives on the Collectives chain today?**  
The **Technical Fellowship** and the **Polkadot Alliance** are the headline collectives hosted by the Collectives system chain.

**2) Is the Fellowship “above” OpenGov?**  
No. It **advises and authorizes** the **Whitelisted Caller** origin for specific, constrained cases; OpenGov still governs enactment via track rules.

**3) Who founded the Alliance?**  
Seven projects: **Acala, Astar, Interlay, KILT, Moonbeam, Phala, Subscan**.

**4) Can individuals join the Alliance?**  
The Alliance is designed *primarily for organizations/projects*; individuals typically engage via their teams or through other programs.

**5) How do I apply to the Fellowship?**  
There’s a rank-based induction process; an interface supports applications, and members progress by contributing evidence over time.

**6) What is Whitelisted Caller, exactly?**  
An origin/track allowing pre-vetted, neutral technical actions to execute faster than Root, subject to Fellowship authorization and track rules.

**7) Is there a Collectives chain on Kusama?**  
No; Collectives exists **only on Polkadot**.

**8) Where can I see activity and metrics?**  
Public analytics dashboards track extrinsics/events and can be extended for custom monitoring.

## Conclusion
Polkadot’s **Collectives** formalize expert stewardship (Fellowship) and ecosystem standards (Alliance) in a transparent, on-chain way—tightening the feedback loop between **builders**, **users**, and **governance**. If you maintain core software or lead an ecosystem team, plug into the relevant collective **now**: align with its process, prepare your evidence, and help upgrade the network responsibly.
