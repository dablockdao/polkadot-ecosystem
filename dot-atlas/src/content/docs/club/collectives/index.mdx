The Polkadot Collectives are a critical evolution within the Polkadot ecosystem, designed to foster collaboration and decentralization on a broader scale. 
These specialized governance groups enable communities to come together with shared goals, whether through creating decentralized organizations (DAOs), funding initiatives, or coordinating large-scale projects.

## Polkadot Collectives: How the Fellowship & Alliance Supercharge OpenGov

Polkadot Collectives are on-chain organizations hosted on the **Collectives system parachain**. Today, the two headline collectives—the **Polkadot Technical Fellowship** and the **Polkadot Alliance**—provide expert stewardship and ecosystem standards that complement OpenGov, enabling safer upgrades, faster incident response, and coordinated community action. Updated **September 2025**. (Polkadot Wiki)

## What are Polkadot Collectives? (ELI5)
Think of **Collectives** as *specialized on-chain groups* dedicated to the long-term health of Polkadot. They live on the **Collectives system chain** and maintain their own membership rules, ranks, and governance processes. Today, the chain hosts the **Technical Fellowship** (expert engineers) and the **Polkadot Alliance** (ecosystem standards & anti-abuse). (Polkadot Wiki)

> **Key fact:** The Collectives system parachain was added to Polkadot via **Referendum 81** and exists **only on Polkadot** (no Kusama equivalent). (Polkadot Wiki)

## Why this matters for builders & governors
* **Safer upgrades:** The Fellowship can whitelist time-critical, low-risk technical proposals using the **Whitelisted Caller** origin/track, allowing faster enactment than Root when appropriate. (Polkadot Wiki)
* **Ecosystem integrity:** The Alliance coordinates projects around shared standards, recognition of good actors, and surfacing of bad practices—reducing user risk and reputational drag. (Polkadot Developer Docs)
* **Clear separation of concerns:** Token-holder OpenGov keeps the final say for broad governance, while collectives supply expert review and codified norms that improve decision quality.

## Landscape at a glance
* **System chain:** *Collectives* (host environment for collective logic, membership, ranks). (Polkadot Wiki)
* **Active collectives:**
  * **Polkadot Technical Fellowship** — ranked individual experts who steward technical safety & upgrades. (Polkadot Wiki)
  * **Polkadot Alliance** — organization-level body promoting standards and exposing misconduct; founded by **Acala, Astar, Interlay, KILT, Moonbeam, Phala, Subscan**. (Subsquare)
* **Data visibility:** Collectives activity is queryable on public analytics (e.g., Dune chain integration for Collectives). (Dune)

## How the Collectives parachain works
**Collectives** is a **system parachain** owned by the network (DOT holders via OpenGov), like Asset Hub or Bridge Hub. It provides runtime pallets for collective membership, ranks, proposals, and actions. New collectives can be added through governance if/when the ecosystem needs them. (OnFinality Blog)

**OpenGov interplay:**
* The **Fellowship** can authorize the **Whitelisted Caller** origin to execute pre-vetted calls with Root-level privileges under stricter constraints (scope, timing), enabling *expedited yet safer* technical enactments. (Polkadot Wiki)
* Tracks and parameters differ from Root to reduce time-to-fix for neutral technical changes (e.g., runtime upgrades). (Polkadot Wiki)

## Collective profiles

### Polkadot Technical Fellowship
A rules-based, ranked membership of individual experts stewarding Polkadot’s technical direction and safety. Ranks (0–9) determine voting weight and responsibilities; higher ranks review/approve **whitelisted** technical actions. The Fellowship replaced Governance V1’s Technical Committee with a more scalable, merit-based structure. (Polkadot Wiki)

**What it does**
* Reviews RFCs, runtime changes, and *time-critical* fixes for safety.
* Votes to authorize **Whitelisted Caller** for eligible proposals.
* Applies rank-weighted voting for internal decisions. (Polkadot Wiki)

**Why builders care**
* Reduced friction for **neutral** technical upgrades that shouldn’t wait through full Root timelines.
* Public process documented via wiki, Polkassembly, and dashboards; better predictability for release trains. (Polkadot Wiki)

**Joining**
* Individuals can apply and progress ranks via evidence of contributions; the process uses on-chain referenda within the collective and rank-based voting. (Polkadot Wiki)

### Polkadot Alliance
An on-chain consortium of projects that codifies **ecosystem standards**, recognizes positive contributors, and surfaces bad actors or anti-user behavior. It was **seeded by seven founding members** (Acala, Astar, Interlay, KILT, Moonbeam, Phala, Subscan) and operates with roles such as *Fellows* and *Allies*. (Subsquare)

**What it does**
* Establishes shared norms for open-source conduct and brand integrity.
* Coordinates responses to ecosystem-wide abuse patterns in collaboration with community safety efforts (e.g., anti-scam initiatives). (Polkadot Developer Docs)

**Why builders care**
* Clear guidance on acceptable practices for listings, claims, and code reuse.
* Reputation benefits for Alliance members when engaging users and partners.

## Collectives vs OpenGov & Treasury: who does what?

## Mini-guide: engaging with a collective
1. **Map your intent.**
   * *Technical change?* Start with the **Fellowship** process (RFC, review, potential whitelist).
   * *Ecosystem standards/recognition?* Engage the **Alliance**.

2. **Prepare evidence.**
   * For Fellowship: link PRs, audits, reproducible test vectors, and an impact/risk brief aligned to neutral, low-risk change criteria. (Polkadot Wiki)
   * For Alliance: show consistent open-source conduct, community service, and conformance with ecosystem norms. (Polkadot Developer Docs)

3. **Use the right venue.**
   * **RFC & technical review** (Fellowship docs / Polkassembly interface). (Polkadot Wiki)
   * **Alliance membership / actions** (Alliance docs & threads). (Subsquare)

4. **Align with OpenGov timelines.**
   * If whitelisting is appropriate, coordinate the **Whitelisted Caller** track for expedited enactment; otherwise follow Root. (Polkadot Wiki)

5. **Communicate and monitor.**
   * Share rationale, risk bounds, and testing results; monitor Dune/telemetry after enactment. (Dune)

## Practical example: fast-tracking a critical runtime fix
* **Scenario:** A parachain-wide bug is discovered; a minimal patch is ready.
* **Path:** Team drafts an RFC + risk assessment → Fellowship review → **Whitelisted Caller** authorization for the call → OpenGov referendum on the Whitelisted Caller track → expedited enactment if approved. (Polkadot Wiki)
* **Outcome:** Safe, timely upgrade without bypassing checks or overusing Root authority.

## Common pitfalls & tips
* **Pitfall:** Confusing token governance with expert review.
  **Tip:** Use **Fellowship** for *neutral technical* vetting; keep policy/strategy questions in broader OpenGov. (Polkadot Wiki)

* **Pitfall:** Requesting Whitelisted Caller for non-urgent/political items.
  **Tip:** The track is designed for **time-critical, low-risk** changes (e.g., runtime hotfixes). (Polkadot Wiki)

* **Pitfall:** Treating Alliance membership as individual recognition.
  **Tip:** Alliance primarily targets **organizations/projects** and ecosystem-level norms. (Polkadot Developer Docs)

* **Pitfall:** Lack of observability post-change.
  **Tip:** Track post-enactment metrics (blocks finalized, extrinsics, errors) via public dashboards. (Dune)
