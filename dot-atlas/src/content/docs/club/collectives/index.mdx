The Polkadot Collectives are a critical evolution within the Polkadot ecosystem, designed to foster collaboration and decentralization on a broader scale.
These specialized governance groups enable communities to come together with shared goals—coordinating technical stewardship, accelerating safe upgrades, and supporting large-scale network initiatives.

## Polkadot Collectives: How the Fellowship Supercharges OpenGov

Polkadot Collectives are on-chain organizations hosted on the **Collectives system parachain**. Today, the headline collective—the **Polkadot Technical Fellowship**—provides expert stewardship that complements OpenGov, enabling safer upgrades, faster incident response, and more predictable release trains. *Updated September 2025.*

## What are Polkadot Collectives? (ELI5)
Think of **Collectives** as *specialized on-chain groups* dedicated to the long-term health of Polkadot. They live on the **Collectives system chain** and maintain their own membership rules, ranks, and governance processes.
> **Key fact:** The Collectives system parachain was added to Polkadot via a network referendum and exists **only on Polkadot** (no Kusama equivalent).

## Why this matters for builders & governors
* **Safer, quicker upgrades:** The Fellowship can enable the **Whitelisted Caller** track for *neutral, low-risk* technical actions, shortening time-to-fix while preserving checks and transparency.
* **Predictable engineering cadence:** Expert, rank-weighted review improves the quality of technical proposals and their alignment with network safety.
* **Clear separation of concerns:** Token-holder OpenGov retains the final say; the Fellowship supplies expert due diligence and pre-vetting.

## Landscape at a glance
* **System chain:** *Collectives* (host environment for collective logic, membership, ranks).
* **Active collective today:** **Polkadot Technical Fellowship** — ranked individual experts stewarding technical safety & upgrades.
* **Data visibility:** Collective activity is trackable via public governance dashboards and chain explorers.

## How the Collectives parachain works
**Collectives** is a **system parachain** owned by the network (DOT holders via OpenGov), like Asset Hub or Bridge Hub. It provides runtime pallets for collective membership, ranks, proposals, and actions. New collectives can be added through governance as the ecosystem evolves.

**OpenGov interplay**
* The **Fellowship** can authorize the **Whitelisted Caller** origin to execute pre-vetted calls with Root-level privileges under strict constraints (scope, timing).
* Track parameters differ from Root to reduce lead-in/confirmation for time-critical, *neutral* upgrades.

## Collective profile: Polkadot Technical Fellowship
A rules-based, ranked membership (levels 0–9) of individual experts stewarding Polkadot’s technical direction and safety. Higher ranks review and approve **whitelist** authorizations for eligible proposals. It replaces Governance V1’s Technical Committee with a more scalable, merit-based structure.

**What it does**
* Reviews RFCs, runtime changes, and urgent fixes for safety and minimal risk.
* Votes to authorize **Whitelisted Caller** for eligible technical actions.
* Uses rank-weighted voting for internal decisions and inductions.

**Why builders care**
* Lower friction for **neutral** technical upgrades that shouldn’t wait for full Root timelines.
* Public, documented processes improve predictability for release trains and incident response.

**Joining**
* Individuals apply and progress ranks with evidence of contributions (PRs, audits, reproducible tests). Inductions and promotions are handled on-chain within the collective.

## Collectives vs OpenGov & Treasury: who does what?

| Function / Body             | Who participates          | Primary scope                     | Typical actions                                         | Time-sensitivity      | Notes                                                                                      |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Technical Fellowship**    | Ranked individual experts | Technical safety & upgrades       | Review RFCs, pre-vet neutral fixes, whitelist calls     | High (for whitelists) | Enables **Whitelisted Caller** with a constrained “fast path” for safe, pre-vetted calls.  |
| **OpenGov (Token holders)** | DOT holders & delegates   | All governance (tracks)           | Referenda on upgrades, treasury, parameters             | Varies by track       | Root vs. Whitelisted Caller have different lead-in/confirmation timelines.                 |
| **Treasury Bounties**       | Curators + community      | Ongoing workstreams               | Fund anti-scam, tooling, education, ops                 | Ongoing               | Good venue for non-runtime initiatives and community operations.                           |

## Mini-guide: engaging with the Fellowship
1. **Map your intent.** If it’s a *technical, neutral, low-risk* change, target the **Fellowship** path (RFC → review → potential whitelist).
2. **Prepare evidence.** Link PRs, audits, test vectors, and a risk/impact brief aligned to whitelist criteria.
3. **Use the right venue.** Follow the Fellowship’s documented process for discussion and signaling.
4. **Align with OpenGov timelines.** If whitelisting fits, coordinate the **Whitelisted Caller** track; otherwise follow Root.
5. **Communicate and monitor.** Share rationale, risk bounds, and testing results; monitor chain health after enactment.

## Practical example: fast-tracking a critical runtime fix
* **Scenario:** A parachain-wide bug is discovered; a minimal patch is ready.
* **Path:** Team drafts an RFC + risk assessment → Fellowship review → **Whitelisted Caller** authorization → OpenGov referendum on the Whitelisted Caller track → expedited enactment if approved.
* **Outcome:** Safe, timely upgrade without overusing Root authority.

## FAQs
**1) What lives on the Collectives chain today?**  
The **Technical Fellowship** is the headline collective currently hosted on the Collectives system chain.

**2) Is the Fellowship “above” OpenGov?**  
No. It **advises and authorizes** the **Whitelisted Caller** origin for specific, constrained cases; OpenGov still governs enactment via track rules.

**3) How do I apply to the Fellowship?**  
There’s a rank-based induction process; an interface supports applications, and members progress by contributing evidence over time.

**4) What is Whitelisted Caller, exactly?**  
An origin/track allowing pre-vetted, *neutral* technical actions to execute faster than Root, subject to Fellowship authorization and track rules.

**5) Is there a Collectives chain on Kusama?**  
No; Collectives exists **only on Polkadot**.

**6) Where can I see activity and metrics?**  
Public dashboards and chain explorers surface extrinsics, referenda, and runtime releases for the Collectives chain and Fellowship-governed upgrades.

## Conclusion
Polkadot’s **Collectives** formalize expert stewardship via the **Technical Fellowship**—tightening the loop between **builders**, **users**, and **governance**. If you maintain core software or lead a team, plug into the Fellowship’s process now: prepare your evidence, align with the right track, and help upgrade the network responsibly.
