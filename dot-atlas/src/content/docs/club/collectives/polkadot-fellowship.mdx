The Polkadot Technical Fellowship represents a groundbreaking governance body within the Polkadot and Kusama networks. Established in 2022, this self-governing collective of experts and developers has been pivotal in advancing the networks’ protocols and ensuring robust, community-led governance through the innovative Polkadot OpenGov system.

## Polkadot Fellowship Foundation and Purpose
**The *Fellowship* was** **created to replace the initial *Technical Committee***, embodying a significant evolution in how Polkadot approaches network governance. It was designed to accommodate a broad spectrum of participants—from newcomers to seasoned experts—and is equipped to scale up to tens of thousands of members, dramatically lowering the barriers to entry. This inclusivity is central to its operational philosophy, enabling a wider community engagement and richer input into the network’s evolution.

### Operational Structure
Operating on multiple fronts, the Fellowship manages its affairs both on-chain, via the **Polkadot Collectives system chain**, and off-chain through the [**Polkadot Fellows repository**](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows). This dual approach allows for a flexible management of technical initiatives and continuous community interaction through platforms like GitHub and various chatrooms. Their monthly development meetings and updates are publicly accessible, typically streamed on platforms like *YouTube*, fostering transparency and ongoing community feedback.

### Governance and Decision-Making
One of the core functions of the Fellowship is to conduct referenda on various technical proposals that impact the networks. These referenda utilize a weighted voting system, where each member’s vote is scaled by their rank within the Fellowship. This ensures that decisions are both democratic and expert-driven, reflecting the collective wisdom of its most experienced members.

### Whitelisting and Proposal Execution
A critical aspect of the Fellowship’s role is in the whitelisting of proposals, allowing them to execute high-stakes operations with Root-level privileges once approved via referenda. This includes the careful orchestration of proposals through the entire lifecycle—from initiation to an OpenGov referendum—ensuring that only thoroughly vetted changes are implemented. Such stringent controls safeguard the network against unwise or malicious modifications.

### Membership and Ranking
Membership to the Fellowship is open to all, starting from rank 0, with a clear path for advancement up to rank 9, based on contributions and expertise. The Fellowship manifesto not only outlines the responsibilities and expectations for each rank but also associates these with a corresponding remuneration structure that mirrors salaries in OECD countries, thereby attracting top talent and maintaining high motivation levels among members.

### Joining the Fellowship
Aspiring members can apply through an interface provided by Polkassembly, supported by the Polkadot treasury. The process of becoming a member is governed by the Fellowship’s rigorous standards, which include upholding the network’s philosophy, operational procedures, and the broader community’s respect.

### Advancement within the Fellowship
The advancement through ranks requires members to periodically demonstrate their contributions and achievements. Members up to rank 4 can be promoted through internal referenda, voted on by peers two ranks higher, ensuring that promotions are endorsed by more senior and experienced members. Higher rank advancements are subject to broader community referenda, reflecting their significant impact on the network’s governance and development.

In conclusion, the Polkadot Technical Fellowship is more than just a governance body; it is a dynamic community of developers and experts dedicated to the continuous improvement and secure operation of the Polkadot and Kusama networks. Through its inclusive and structured approach to network governance, it ensures that the Polkadot ecosystem remains cutting-edge and community-driven.

## 10 Key Aspects of the Polkadot Fellowship:
1. **Membership and Rank**: The Fellowship is structured with a hierarchical ranking system, where members ascend through demonstrating expertise and contribution to the network. Entry into the Fellowship begins with candidacy and progresses through various ranks, each associated with increasing responsibilities and recognition.
2. **Technical Expertise**: The Fellowship primarily values technical expertise relevant to the Polkadot protocol. Members are expected to contribute to the development, formalization, and improvement of core protocol components. As they advance in rank, their contributions and leadership roles expand.
3. **Governance Role**: The Fellowship members hold an influential voice within the Polkadot governance model, known as **Polkadot OpenGov**. While they do not unilaterally control the protocol’s direction, their collective expertise is recognized and can guide technical decision-making through the governance apparatus, including on-chain voting mechanisms.
4. **Promotion and Continuity**: The advancement of members within the Fellowship is based on peer evaluation and contributions to the network. Members are encouraged to maintain their rank through active participation and can be promoted based on the merit of their work.
5. **Fostering Expertise**: The Fellowship is aimed not only at recognizing existing talent but also at nurturing new expertise. It provides a structure for mentoring and development, ensuring that there is a consistent pipeline of skilled individuals supporting the network.
6. **Operational Decentralization**: The Fellowship addresses the need for operational decentralization by distributing the power of decision-making among a group of knowledgeable individuals. This helps to avoid centralization risks that can come from a concentrated group of node operators or developers controlling the network.
7. **Economic and Political Considerations**: The manifesto acknowledges the influence of economic disparity and organizational privilege in the decentralization of commercial networks. The Fellowship aims to mitigate such issues by providing a balanced and **meritocratic platform for governance**.
8. **Decentralization Philosophy**: The Fellowship embraces the broader philosophy of Polkadot, which champions political decentralization and the empowerment of individual actors within the network to influence outcomes and ensure that the system functions as intended.
9. **Inclusivity and Education**: The Fellowship, while exclusive in its membership, also focuses on spreading knowledge and educating the wider community about the technicalities and philosophies underpinning the Polkadot network.
10. **Rewards and Recognition**: The Fellowship system includes allowances and prizes to financially support members’ contributions and incentivize ongoing participation and excellence within the network.

In essence, the **Polkadot Fellowship** plays a pivotal role in shaping the future of the Polkadot ecosystem by cultivating and **leveraging technical expertise within a decentralized governance framework**. It ensures that the growth and development of the network are driven by those who have demonstrated their capabilities and commitment to its success.
