**265Dots** is a financial and business development firm operating within the Polkadot ecosystem. With offices in Zug, Amsterdam, and Luxembourg, the company focuses on fostering relationships between institutional investors and blockchain-based technologies, with a specific emphasis on Polkadot.

## Focus and Objectives

265Dots operates at the intersection of blockchain and traditional finance. Its core activities involve investor relations and ecosystem development, targeting institutional stakeholders such as **venture capital firms**, **family offices**, and **financial institutions**. The aim is to facilitate awareness, capital access, and strategic collaboration for initiatives connected to the **Polkadot protocol**.

The firm’s work centers on integrating institutional capital into the Polkadot ecosystem through outreach and strategic advisory, aligning long-term investors with opportunities in decentralized technologies.

## Institutional Collaboration and Financial Network

265Dots collaborates with a network of financial entities including:

- **Venture capital** groups focusing on blockchain and early-stage startups  
- **Private equity firms** exploring long-term investments in decentralized infrastructure  
- **Asset managers** seeking exposure to Web3-related opportunities  

These collaborations are designed to create capital access pathways for teams building on Polkadot, contributing to the network’s broader economic activity and infrastructure support.

## Team and Geographic Presence

The team at 265Dots includes professionals with backgrounds in **traditional capital markets** and **cryptocurrency sectors**, allowing the firm to operate across financial and regulatory environments. This cross-sector experience is intended to support informed dialogue between blockchain developers and financial stakeholders.

The company is currently active in three jurisdictions:

- **Switzerland (Zug)** – Headquarters  
- **The Netherlands (Amsterdam)** – Regional office  
- **Luxembourg** – Through the acquisition of Novus Management S.à r.l  

This geographic spread supports compliance and investor engagement across European financial centers.


## Notable Initiatives

### Polkadot House Amsterdam  
On **June 5, 2025**, 265Dots organized the opening of the **Polkadot House** in Amsterdam, marked by the traditional closing of the trading day at **Euronext**. The event aimed to introduce a new initiative, *The Gateway of Polkadot by 265Dots*, which focuses on connecting Polkadot-based projects with institutional finance.  

### Acquisition of Novus Management  
The acquisition of **Novus Management S.à r.l** added fund management capabilities to the firm’s services. According to 265Dots, this development contributes to its jurisdictional expansion and complements existing activities such as **over-the-counter (OTC) distribution**.

In the words of [Wilhelm Roth](https://x.com/WilhelmtRoth): "This acquisition represents the addition of fund management as part of our suit of services, such as OTC distribution. Additionally it showcases a steady jurisdictional growth for the firm, with our Swiss, Dutch and now Luxembourgish presence. 265 Dots AG keeps on growing and in such elevate the advantages of utilizing Polkadot and the active role we take in the markets"
