Ech0’s Laboratory is a dedicated security-focused operator within the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems, striving to maintain reliable and transparent validation services. 
Supported by the Decentralized Nodes program from the Web3 Foundation, Ech0’s Laboratory demonstrates its commitment to blockchain security, robust hardware infrastructure, and responsive communication channels. 
Below is an overview of how the organization achieves these standards and why nominators can trust their operations.

## Polkadot and Kusama Validators
Ech0’s Laboratory currently operates one validator on the Kusama network and one validator on the Polkadot network. 
Both validators have established reputations for reliability, with consistently monitored performance metrics and on-chain verification of their identities.

### Kusama Validator
- **Identity**: Ech0.re/01  
- **Stash Address**: `Dfw2gjWfm19j3Q9ewn9PJiDyCdFsBs9QQ2ZiRAZ3k2QNVar`  
- **Commission Fee**: 10%  
- **Telemetry Name**: EchoStake-KSM-01  

### Polkadot Validator
- **Identity**: ECH0.RE/01  
- **Stash Address**: `126cWhehuBFhQvbDqt26dWBNgELfkpc72WvJV3sx82qRogkT`  
- **Commission Fee**: 4%  
- **Telemetry Name**: EchoStake-DOT-01  

Ech0’s Laboratory is actively accepting new nominations and aims to become fully independent from the Decentralized Nodes program by 2025.

## Hardware and Hosting
To maintain a high standard of security and performance, Ech0’s Laboratory leverages **dedicated bare metal servers** hosted at OVH in France (Roubaix). 
These servers adhere to the recommended security practices for blockchain validators, ensuring robust uptime and consistent block production.
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS x86_64  
- **RAM**: 64 GB DDR5 ECC On-Die (5200 MHz)  
- **CPU**: AMD EPYC 4344P (8 cores / 16 threads, 3.8 GHz / 5.3 GHz)  
- **Storage**: 2×960 GB SSD NVMe RAID 1  
- **Public Bandwidth**: 1 Gb/s  

Regular monitoring and proactive maintenance help ensure that each validator remains stable and meets the rigorous demands of Polkadot and Kusama networks.

## On-Chain Identity and Communication
Since nominators entrust their funds to validators, transparency and accessibility are paramount. Ech0’s Laboratory verifies its on-chain identities on both Polkadot and Kusama through Polkassembly. 
The team is readily reachable via multiple channels:

- **Email**: [me@ech0.re](mailto:me@ech0.re)  
- **X/Twitter**: [@ech0re](https://twitter.com/ech0re)  
- **Element/Matrix**: `@ech0.re:matrix.org`  
- **Discord**: `ech0.re`  
- **Website**: [https://ech0.re](https://ech0.re)

## Assets Security and Hardware Wallets

Protecting staked assets is a critical concern in blockchain validation. Ech0’s Laboratory employs **hardware cold wallets** featuring secure elements to minimize risk. The following devices are used to store validator keys and execute essential transactions:

1. **Ledger Nano S Plus** (Backup Device)  
2. **Ledger Nano X** (Live Device, used for urgent actions)  
3. **Ledger Flex** (Live Device, additionally used for NFC security authentication)

Each device is protected by a PIN and remains fully encrypted. Three consecutive failed PIN attempts result in a complete wipe of the stored keys, significantly enhancing security.

### Seed Phrase Protection
The seed phrase for Ech0’s Laboratory is engraved on a **Cryptotag Zeus** metal plate, ensuring it remains waterproof, fireproof, corrosion-proof, and even bulletproof. This backup measure guarantees continuity in the event of device failure or loss.

## Proxies for Efficient Operations
Ech0’s Laboratory employs proxy accounts, set up in the Nova hot wallet, to perform routine tasks (e.g., bonding, commission adjustments, session key updates, and governance voting) without repeatedly exposing the main hardware wallets.
- **Staking Proxy (Polkadot)**: `13THs2ArG9dkJxqLUvEDYiCy7aGmYRvdoz5iyrkSTegJ4FdV`  
- **Staking Proxy (Kusama)**: `F2cP1Ff2jPCd5eGHyzGJWjpQYZMeoBgBsBzDE33PMsGcw55`  
- **Governance Proxy (Polkadot)**: `16g6ZBYbEP3kRMgVBki7zdvdGpymXDyHWzj3D3rDaEATXzc8`  
- **Governance Proxy (Kusama)**: `JFR5AdPzxoCjUVQzpUAkSTUZoGMdbEKtsqJSR8pVwMS6Voi`

These proxies facilitate day-to-day validator operations while preserving the highest level of security for underlying private keys.

## Self Stake for Aligned Incentives
To demonstrate commitment and alignment with network security, Ech0’s Laboratory bonds a significant amount of personal funds into its validators:
- **Kusama**: 170 KSM  
- **Polkadot**: 8,000 DOT staked for validation, plus an additional 3,000 DOT for nomination  
- **Total**: 11,000 DOT and 170 KSM at stake  

Because these funds are susceptible to slashing in cases of misconduct or downtime, Ech0’s Laboratory underscores its dedication to secure and compliant operation.

## About Ech0’s Laboratory
