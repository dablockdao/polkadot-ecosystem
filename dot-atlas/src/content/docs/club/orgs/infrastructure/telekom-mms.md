It involves users depositing their cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, Celo, or **Polkadot**, as a “stake” to actively participate in transaction validation and network security. In return, stakers receive rewards in the form of additional cryptocurrency, providing a lucrative opportunity to grow their digital assets while contributing to the stability and security of the blockchain network.
