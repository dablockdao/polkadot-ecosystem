**BOTLabs GmbH** is a Berlin-based technology company at the forefront of developing decentralized identity applications for the Web3 ecosystem. Founded in 2018, BOTLabs is the initial developer of the **KILT Protocol**, a blockchain framework designed to generate **decentralized identifiers (DIDs)** and **verifiable credentials**. By creating cutting-edge software and services "Built on KILT," BOTLabs empowers individuals and enterprises to manage digital identities securely and privately.

## KILT Protocol: The Foundation of Decentralized Identity
At the core of BOTLabs' innovation is the **KILT Protocol**, a blockchain solution designed to return control of personal data to users. KILT enables the creation of DIDs and verifiable credentials, allowing individuals to prove their identity without relying on centralized authorities. This aligns with the principles of Web3, where decentralization and data sovereignty are paramount.

## BOTLabs' Key Products and Services
1. **SocialKYC:** **SocialKYC** is an identity verification service that allows users to prove ownership of email addresses and social media accounts. It generates credentials that can be shared with online services without compromising personal data. A key feature of SocialKYC is its commitment to privacy—it "forgets" the user and the credential as soon as the credential is issued, ensuring no personal data is stored, siloed, or shared.
2. **DIDsign:** **DIDsign** enables users to sign and timestamp digital files directly in their browser using their unique KILT DID. The signed files can be downloaded as a zip and shared via email, Telegram, or WhatsApp. Recipients can easily verify the file’s authenticity using the DIDsign website. Importantly, signing, sending, and verifying files with DIDsign is always free.
3. **web3name (w3n):** **web3name** is a custom, unique name that represents an individual's on-chain DID. This user-friendly identifier can be linked with SocialKYC credentials and blockchain addresses across multiple ecosystems, enhancing verification and trust in digital transactions.
4. **Stakeboard:** The **Stakeboard** web application allows users to stake KILT tokens and earn rewards. By backing collators—entities responsible for maintaining the KILT blockchain—users receive KILT Coins when their supported collators successfully produce blocks. Stakeboard offers flexibility, allowing users to claim rewards or stop staking at any time.
5. **Account Linking:** **Account Linking** simplifies identity management by connecting a user's web3name and DID to multiple blockchain addresses. This functionality spans the KILT blockchain, the broader Polkadot ecosystem, and soon, Ethereum. It also enables credentials to be publicly linked for additional verification, which is particularly valuable for collators and blockchain service providers.
