In May 2024, Transistor announced its candidacy to become a delegate in the second cohort of the Decentralized Voices program, a key initiative aimed at fostering balanced governance within the Polkadot ecosystem. 
This New York-based Web3 development firm also unveiled plans to accept public delegations of DOT tokens, reflecting its commitment to the principles of OpenGov and decentralized decision-making. With a strategic vision and proven expertise, Transistor is poised to contribute significantly to the Polkadot ecosystem's growth and long-term sustainability.

#### Transistor's Governance Philosophy
At the heart of Transistor's candidacy lies a straightforward governance philosophy: all treasury proposals will be evaluated based on their potential to enhance the economic value of the Polkadot ecosystem. By prioritizing adoption-focused initiatives over hype-driven projects, Transistor seeks to break free from past strategies that have hindered Polkadot's perception among key stakeholders, including U.S.-based developers, investors, and media.
Transistor emphasizes that true success in OpenGov requires inclusivity, particularly welcoming contributors who may lack traditional "skin in the game." The firm\u2019s leadership openly rejects narrow interpretations of governance that prioritize voting history over the broader value brought by experience, education, and ethical decision-making. Additionally, Transistor\u2019s substantial but balanced DOT holdings ensure alignment with the community\u2019s long-term goals without susceptibility to undue influence.

#### A Proven Approach to Proposal Evaluation
Transistor rigorous assessment protocol underscores its commitment to effective governance. The firm evaluates treasury proposals based on comprehensive due diligence, including the proposer\u2019s background, motivation, and potential risk factors. Proposals undergo analysis using metrics such as ROI, opportunity cost, and economic impact on Polkadot, ensuring decisions are data-driven and aligned with the network's strategic goals.
Moreover, Transistor champions fair and measurable KPIs, region-specific spending plans, and transparent milestones. By combining its expertise in economic value creation, tokenomics, and tech-driven business models, the team aims to support proposals that sustainably enhance Polkadot\u2019s ecosystem while opposing wasteful or exploitative initiatives.

#### Advancing Polkadot's Growth in the United States
In August 2024, the Web3 Foundation awarded Transistor a grant under the "Decentralized Futures" program, recognizing its potential to drive Polkadot\u2019s adoption in the U.S. market. Transistor\u2019s strategic approach, bolstered by deep industry connections, positions it to establish a robust Polkadot community in North America, with New York City as a focal point.
Led by co-founders Peter Mauric and Yoon Kim, Transistor brings a unique blend of blockchain expertise and financial acumen to this endeavor. Mauric\u2019s extensive experience includes pivotal roles at Parity Technologies and the Web3 Foundation, where he helped launch Polkadot, Kusama, and their parachains. Kim\u2019s background in Wall Street tech investing and hedge fund management complements this technical expertise, bridging traditional finance and the Web3 space to attract meaningful investment and enterprise adoption.

#### Collaboration and Ecosystem Integration
As part of its mission, Transistor collaborates with other Decentralized Futures-funded teams to promote the Polkadot tech stack among U.S. enterprises and investors. By aligning with Polkadot\u2019s core values of interoperability and scalability, Transistor aims to strengthen the network\u2019s competitive position and foster both on-chain and off-chain community growth.
The firm's innovative approach includes leveraging its grant to establish a Polkadot \u201cHQ\u201d in New York City, serving as a hub for ecosystem participants. This initiative builds on Transistor\u2019s previous treasury proposal experience and highlights its commitment to improving the governance process under the Decentralized Voices program.

#### Driving Polkadot's Long-Term Success
Transistor\u2019s vision extends beyond short-term gains. By embracing efficient capital allocation, fostering community engagement, and leveraging its leadership\u2019s deep understanding of blockchain technology and governance structures, the firm is dedicated to ensuring Polkadot\u2019s sustainable growth. Its DAO-based approach to the Decentralized Voices delegate role further reflects its ethos of collaboration and transparency.
In a landscape often characterized by speculative ventures, Transistor\u2019s steadfast focus on economic value creation and effective governance positions it as a key driver of Polkadot\u2019s future. As the firm continues its work under the Decentralized Futures program, it stands as a vital partner in building a decentralized, interoperable, and innovative blockchain ecosystem.
