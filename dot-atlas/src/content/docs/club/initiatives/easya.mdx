EasyA is on a mission to empower students and developers to shape the decentralized future. Through its partnership with Polkadot, EasyA has introduced the EasyA x Polkadot University, an ambitious program designed to educate, inspire, and support university students in launching groundbreaking projects within the Polkadot ecosystem.

## Bridging Universities and Blockchain Innovation
EasyA has made significant strides in embedding blockchain education within top universities such as Harvard, MIT, Stanford, Cambridge, and Oxford. Its partnership with Polkadot takes this initiative to new heights, leveraging Polkadot’s robust ecosystem to attract top talent from around the globe. The program focuses on three core pillars:
1. **Education:** EasyA integrates Polkadot’s educational resources, such as the EdX course, into its app and in-person workshops. These resources simplify complex blockchain concepts, enabling students to master Substrate, Rust, and Polkadot’s architecture seamlessly.
2. **Hackathons:** By hosting large-scale hackathons at prestigious institutions like Harvard and in major cities like London, EasyA provides students with hands-on opportunities to build and test their ideas. These events attract hundreds of talented developers, fostering a collaborative environment to create innovative projects.
3. **Funding and Support:** EasyA’s microgrants program ensures that promising student-led projects receive the financial backing they need. Grants of up to $10,000 can be approved within 72 hours, accelerating the development of impactful solutions.

## A Proven Track Record of Success
Since its founding in 2019 by Phil and Dom Kwok, EasyA has grown into a community of nearly one million developers, with a combined valuation of startups launched through its hackathons exceeding $3 billion. Alumni have gone on to secure funding from leading venture capital firms such as Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Y Combinator (YC), and Founders Fund. The success stories include projects that started as university experiments and evolved into multimillion-dollar enterprises.

## The EasyA x Polkadot University: Building a Decentralized Future
Polkadot’s mission to foster interoperability and scalability in blockchain aligns perfectly with EasyA’s commitment to developer education. The EasyA x Polkadot University is a decentralized initiative spanning university campuses worldwide. Students can learn about Polkadot through the EasyA app, attend university workshops, and participate in hackathons. This structure ensures that participants can seamlessly integrate the program into their academic and professional lives.
Key benefits of the EasyA x Polkadot University include:

- **Global Accessibility:** Students from any part of the world can participate, thanks to a hybrid approach combining online and in-person events.
- **Diverse Opportunities:** Whether a participant is interested in decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, or developer tooling, EasyA provides tailored support to bring their vision to life.
- **Network Building:** With access to a community of over 1 million developers and connections to leading blockchain VCs, participants gain invaluable exposure and mentorship opportunities.

## Driving Ecosystem Growth
The EasyA x Polkadot University also serves as a vital growth engine for the Polkadot ecosystem. By attracting young, talented developers, the program addresses the ecosystem’s pressing need for fresh talent and innovative projects. Initiatives such as the #60DaysOfPolkadot campaign have already demonstrated EasyA’s ability to generate significant momentum, attracting over 40,000 developers to explore Polkadot’s capabilities.
Looking ahead, EasyA plans to expand its efforts with the #180DaysOfPolkadot campaign and additional hackathons at global universities. These initiatives aim to build on the program’s success, fostering long-term engagement and positioning Polkadot as the go-to blockchain for student innovators.

## Empowering the Next Generation of Blockchain Leaders
EasyA’s vision is clear: to find and nurture the next Vitalik Buterin or Robert Habermeier within university communities. By providing students with the tools, resources, and funding they need, EasyA x Polkadot University ensures that the brightest minds have the opportunity to shape the future of Web3.
For students, developers, and blockchain enthusiasts, EasyA is more than just a program—it is a movement. By combining education, innovation, and community, EasyA is unlocking the full potential of blockchain technology, one student at a time.
