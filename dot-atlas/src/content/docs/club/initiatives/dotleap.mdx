**DotLeap is a comprehensive newsletter dedicated to providing in-depth coverage of the Polkadot ecosystem**. Curated by experts, it offers readers the latest updates, insights, and analyses on Polkadotâ€™s developments, technological innovations, and strategic movements. The newsletter serves as a valuable resource for staying informed about governance proposals, staking opportunities, and key events within the community.

DotLeap also maintains an **active presence on social media**, particularly on X (formerly Twitter), where it engages with the Polkadot community by sharing timely news, updates, and discussions. 

DotLeap has recently been transferred to new ownership. 
Now operated by [gbaci](https://x.com/gbaciX), who was involved with DotLeap from 2021 to 2023, is committed to revitalizing the project. 
The publication will return to its roots as a weekly newsletter, addressing past issues like the unfulfilled expansion campaign funded by 37,851 DOT. 
The owner aims to restore the brand by ensuring at least six months of consistent content before seeking funding again, and is focused on demonstrating that passionate community members can rebuild and reenergize community-driven initiatives within the Polkadot ecosystem.
