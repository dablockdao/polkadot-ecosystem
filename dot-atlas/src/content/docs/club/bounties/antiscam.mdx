#### Reactive Activities
Despite proactive measures, scams can still occur. The Anti-Scam Team’s reactive track investigates and responds to scam incidents within the Polkadot ecosystem. Their primary goal is to assist users who have lost funds to fraudulent activities. By identifying malicious actors and collaborating with entities like Merkel Science, the team aims to prevent further scams and recover lost assets.
#### Outreach
Outreach is a critical component of the Anti-Scam Team’s efforts. This track works closely with the educational team to spread awareness about different types of scams and protective measures. By collaborating with other organizations, the outreach team amplifies its message, reaching a wider audience and fostering a well-informed community. Through strategic partnerships, they aim to cultivate a culture of vigilance and resilience against fraud.
## Polkadot Anti-Scam Collective
The Polkadot Anti-Scam Collective is a planned on-chain, ranked-membership organization dedicated to maintaining the ecosystem’s safety. Through collective efforts, members work to identify and mitigate scams. This initiative’s repository outlines its goals, value proposition, membership structure, and rules for induction and promotion.

### Polkadot Anti-Scam Bounty
#### Purpose of the Bounty
Scams are a pervasive issue in the blockchain industry. The Polkadot Anti-Scam Bounty aims to incentivize the community to actively combat scams and protect users. This proposal seeks to create a holistic solution by addressing multiple aspects of scam prevention, including raising awareness and educating users. The bounty, distributed through child bounties, encourages community participation in anti-scam efforts.
#### Implementation and Evolution
The child bounties will be rolled out gradually, with detailed parameters defined before each launch. This evolving process will adapt based on community feedback and experience. The initiative’s main goals are to move operations on-chain, be community-driven, and provide comprehensive anti-scam coverage across the Polkadot ecosystem.
