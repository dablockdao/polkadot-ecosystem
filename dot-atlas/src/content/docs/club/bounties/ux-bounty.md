## Objectives of the Polkadot UX Bounty
The Polkadot UX Bounty seeks to:

- **Improve Accessibility:** By resolving existing UX challenges, the initiative aims to make the Polkadot ecosystem more user-friendly and approachable for a broad audience.
- **Standardize UX Practices:** Establishing and promoting best practices across the ecosystem to ensure consistency and high-quality user interactions.
- **Foster Innovation:** Leveraging the Polkadot SDK to develop cutting-edge solutions that enhance usability and drive adoption.
- **Engage the Community:** Encouraging collaboration among ecosystem participants to create a more inclusive and responsive development environment.

## Structure and Governance
The bounty is managed under the supervision of Braille, a Web3 UX/UI agency co-founded by Benoit Campagnaud and Alexandre Houdart. Braille’s team includes experts in UX/UI design, UX research, branding, and frontend development. Their mission is to simplify blockchain experiences through innovative design and agile methodologies.

A team of six curators, including leaders from prominent ecosystem projects such as OpenGovWatch, Parity, Apillon, SubWallet, and Velocity Labs, oversees the bounty through a 4/6 multisig mechanism. These curators are responsible for prioritizing UX issues, allocating funds, and ensuring high-quality deliverables.

## Key Components of the Initiative
### 1. UX Best Practices & Standardization
To ensure a unified user experience, the initiative emphasizes the adoption of standardized practices. Activities include:

- Conducting UX studies to identify pain points and opportunities for improvement.
- Engaging with core developers, ecosystem partners, and the community through RFCs, forums, and open calls.
- Creating a Common Good Design Library, featuring guidelines and assets to streamline design processes. The library’s first component, a cross-chain swap feature, is already under development.

### 2. Systematic Project Management
A structured approach ensures effective implementation and integration of UX enhancements. This includes:

- Maintaining a backlog of UX issues, prioritized based on impact and urgency.
- Developing user stories and requirements for identified issues.
- Collaborating with experts to design and test solutions, ensuring they meet quality standards.
- Incentivizing projects to adopt UX recommendations.

### 3. Community Involvement
The initiative prioritizes collaboration with the broader Polkadot community. By hosting OpenUX calls, town halls, and workshops, Braille gathers valuable input from stakeholders, fostering a cooperative environment and ensuring community needs drive UX improvements.

## Roles and Responsibilities
### Braille as the Bounty Operator
Braille plays a central role in coordinating and executing the bounty. Their responsibilities include:

- Curating and cataloging UX issues across the ecosystem.
- Facilitating collaboration among developers, users, and service providers.
- Conducting UX research to identify pain points and propose solutions.
- Managing administrative tasks, including onboarding participants and tracking progress.
- Leading community engagement efforts to integrate diverse perspectives into the UX improvement process.

### Curators
The curators support Braille by:
- Defining the scope of tasks and managing financial resources.
- Approving funding based on predefined milestones.
- Offering technical insights and conducting UX testing when needed.

## Funding and Accountability
Projects under the bounty are funded based on predefined milestones to ensure accountability and efficient resource allocation. Deliverables are rigorously assessed against quality standards before the release of funds. This structured approach ensures the initiative’s objectives are met effectively.

## Conclusion
The Polkadot UX Bounty represents a significant step forward in enhancing the user experience within the ecosystem. By addressing accessibility challenges and fostering innovation, this initiative positions Polkadot as a leader in blockchain usability. With the collaborative efforts of Braille, the curators, and the broader community, the Polkadot ecosystem is set to achieve a seamless and intuitive user experience, driving greater adoption and engagement.
