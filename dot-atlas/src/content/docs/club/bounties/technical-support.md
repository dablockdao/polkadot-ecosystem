The **Polkadot Technical Support Bounty Guide** is a structured process designed to provide efficient and specialized technical assistance to projects and stakeholders within the Polkadot ecosystem. Its purpose is to enhance the user experience by connecting individuals and teams with qualified technicians who can address specific technical needs, such as issues related to Substrate, Ink, XCM, UI/UX, and other ecosystem tools.

This guide outlines the steps for both requesting and offering technical support services, as well as the necessary forms to submit and the process for claiming bounties upon completion of a support task. The initiative promotes collaboration between business development (BD) teams, ambassadors, and technicians, ensuring that the ecosystem can operate smoothly with high-quality, timely solutions.

## Key features include:
- Submission of requests for technical support.
- Approval and selection of technicians to handle tasks.
- Completion and feedback collection after the service.
- Bounty claiming process through the Polkadot.js platform.
- A focus on services that improve technical infrastructure and end-user experience, excluding project-building or solution development costs.

This bounty system helps foster continuous improvement and specialized support for the growing needs within the Polkadot ecosystem.
