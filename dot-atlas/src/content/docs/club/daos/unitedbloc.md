*A Validators Collaborative DAO for the Moonbeam Ecosystem*

**UnitedBloc** is a **decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)** formed by a coalition of independent collators within the [**Moonbeam ecosystem**](https://dablock.com/dapps/moonbeam-network/). This group, driven by the belief that “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts,” aims to enhance community value through collective efforts. Comprised of 13 collators from 11 countries across four continents, UnitedBloc leverages diverse skills and perspectives to support and improve the Moonbeam network.

## UnitedBloc Core Mission and Values
UnitedBloc’s mission is to provide significant community value to the Moonbeam, Moonriver, and Moonbase Alpha parachains by harnessing the collective power of its members. The organization is committed to:

1. **High-Quality Community Contributions**: Each member actively maintains nodes on the Moonbase Alpha testnet and participates in community forums and governance.
2. **Provision of Essential Tools**: UnitedBloc members offer a range of utilities, including informational websites, database snapshots, security recommendations, monitoring tools, GeoDNS, and regional load balancing.
3. **Public RPC Services**: UnitedBloc provides free public Remote Procedure Call (RPC) nodes, distributed globally across eight bare metal servers, ensuring reliable and balanced access to Moonbase, Moonriver, and Moonbeam chains.

## UnitedBloc Key Contributions
- **Moonbase Alpha Participation:** UnitedBloc members are dedicated to operating collators and RPC nodes on the Moonbase Alpha testnet. This involvement ensures the testnet remains performant and functional, which is crucial for the overall stability and development of the Moonbeam ecosystem.

- **Community Tools and Resources:** The coalition members provide various tools and resources that benefit the broader Moonbeam community. These include security recommendations, database snapshots, monitoring tools, and regionally balanced load services. Such contributions help in maintaining a robust and secure network environment.

- **Globally Balanced RPC Nodes:** UnitedBloc offers publicly accessible RPC nodes that are globally service balanced using GeoDNS and regionally balanced via OpenResty. This setup involves eight bare metal servers distributed worldwide, providing reliable RPC access for Moonbase, Moonriver, and Moonbeam chains. The system’s architecture ensures high availability and scalability, accommodating increased demand as necessary.

## UnitedBloc Community Engagement and Continuous Improvement

UnitedBloc places a strong emphasis on community engagement. Coalition members are active in Discord channels, providing assistance and fostering a friendly, informative environment. This engagement plays a vital role in maintaining the vibrant social space within the Moonbeam and Moonriver communities.

Continuous improvement is a cornerstone of UnitedBloc’s philosophy. The organization is committed to evolving with the changing needs of the Moonbeam ecosystem, ensuring that its contributions remain relevant and valuable. This dedication to improvement involves regularly updating tools, refining processes, and exploring new ways to add value to the community.

### Performance and Reliability

#### Maintenance and Uptime
UnitedBloc members are known for their meticulous attention to maintenance, ensuring that they promptly address Foundation requests for information or upgrades. This proactive approach prevents issues that could lead to poor block production. Collective monitoring within the coalition ensures that no collator remains in a failed state for extended periods, maintaining high network reliability.

#### Rapid Response
The organization prioritizes quick and effective responses to security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and other emergencies. UnitedBloc maintains a private contact list for 24/7 communication among collators, ensuring rapid coordination and resolution of any problems that arise. This level of preparedness addresses a significant challenge in permissionless systems, where anonymity can hinder timely responses.

### Conclusion
UnitedBloc exemplifies the power of collaboration within the blockchain space. By uniting independent collators under a shared mission, the DAO significantly enhances the value provided to the Moonbeam ecosystem. Through their collective efforts in maintaining nodes, offering essential tools, providing reliable RPC services, and engaging with the community, UnitedBloc members demonstrate the profound impact of teamwork and continuous improvement in the blockchain industry.
