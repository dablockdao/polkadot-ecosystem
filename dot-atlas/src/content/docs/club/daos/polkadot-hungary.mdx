Polkadot Hungary is a DAO that has been a cornerstone in the development and promotion of the Polkadot network within Hungary. Founded by Six, the Regional Head Ambassador for Polkadot, the organization has been actively involved in shaping the local blockchain community since 2020. Polkadot Hungary DAO not only plays a pivotal role in fostering the Polkadot ecosystem but also contributes significantly to governance, education, and community-building efforts on both the Polkadot and Kusama networks.

## The Vision of Polkadot Hungary DAO
Polkadot Hungary DAO envisions Polkadot as the Web3 standard, mirroring the decentralized and unstoppable ethos that Bitcoin first proposed. By supporting technical and venture-focused referendums, the organization seeks to drive global positive change, ensuring the long-term sustainability and growth of the network. At its core, Polkadot Hungary embraces a solarpunk vision where technological advancements are used to enhance individual freedoms, empower people, and reduce reliance on centralized systems. This aligns with their overarching goal of creating a decentralized ecosystem where innovation and inclusivity are paramount.

## Governance and Decision-Making Process
The governance structure of Polkadot Hungary DAO is rooted in a meritocratic yet pragmatic approach to decision-making. The DAO operates a multisig wallet, through which key members actively participate in the Polkadot on-chain governance system, OpenGov. This allows the DAO to vote on Polkadot referendums, ensuring that the organization’s votes are aligned with the community's best interests. The Polkadot Hungary DAO's governance process is characterized by transparency, accountability, and a thorough evaluation of proposals.

Decisions within the DAO are made collaboratively, with weekly internal calls to discuss proposals and technical developments. This ensures that all votes are well-informed and backed by collective expertise. The team is committed to maintaining a high level of involvement in Polkadot’s governance, ensuring that only proposals with clear value propositions and sustainable business models are supported.

## The Role of Polkadot Hungary DAO in the Ecosystem
Polkadot Hungary DAO’s activities extend beyond governance participation. The organization has been instrumental in organizing numerous Polkadot-related events, including over 30 meetups, two Polkadot Championship Hackathons, and the flagship Polkadot Day during Budapest Blockchain Week in 2024. These events have helped to solidify the organization’s role as a key player in the local blockchain scene.

The DAO also runs a nomination pool for staking and is a prominent advocate for Web3 education. Through its website and Telegram channel, Polkadot Hungary DAO provides the Hungarian community with valuable resources, news, and insights on the Polkadot ecosystem. The organization is committed to educating its members on Polkadot’s mechanisms and helping them navigate the complexities of blockchain technology.

Additionally, Polkadot Hungary DAO advocates for sustainable network growth. The DAO has voiced concerns over current marketing strategies and believes that the network's funds should be used to support sustainable business models rather than one-off sponsorships with questionable outcomes. They are more supportive of partnerships that have tangible long-term value, such as those in the vein of Heroic.gg, over less strategic ventures like sports sponsorships.
