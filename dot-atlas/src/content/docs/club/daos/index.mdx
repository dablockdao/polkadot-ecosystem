Polkadot DAO communities are vibrant, decentralized groups built around shared goals and values, leveraging blockchain for transparent governance and collaboration. These communities thrive on Polkadot’s interoperable network, enabling members to propose ideas, vote on initiatives, and manage resources collectively. By removing centralized control, Polkadot DAOs empower individuals and organizations to work together seamlessly, driving innovation and fostering inclusive decision-making across diverse sectors.

## Polkadot DAOs & Decentralized Voices (DV): How Delegations Power OpenGov in 2025
This guide explains how **Polkadot DAOs** and the **Decentralized Voices (DV)** program work together to improve on-chain decision-making. You’ll learn what DV is (and what changed in Cohort 5), how **multi-role delegation** works in OpenGov, which tools to use, and a practical, step-by-step workflow to delegate to **DV DAOs** or other trusted delegates.

## ELI5: DAOs, OpenGov, and DV
* **DAOs on Polkadot** are organized communities (often multisig-backed) that coordinate funding, research, and governance.
* **OpenGov** is Polkadot’s governance system: everything happens on-chain, across separate **tracks** (e.g., Treasury vs Root).
* **DV (Decentralized Voices)** is a Web3 Foundation program that **delegates voting power** to diverse, doxxed delegates (increasingly **DAOs**) so decisions reflect more informed perspectives. The program lends a pool of voting power to broaden participation.

## What is DV (Decentralized Voices)?
**DV** lends foundation-held voting weight to carefully selected community delegates to **amplify informed participation** in OpenGov. The program began in early **2024** and continues to iterate to reduce bottlenecks, diversify viewpoints, and improve transparency of rationales.

> Key fact: The DV program publicly states its total delegated pool and a clear application process, including identity requirements and a published governance stance.

## Cohort 5 (Sep 2025–Jan 2026): What changed
**DV 5** introduced two notable shifts:

1. **More delegate seats; smaller per-seat clout** — reduces the chance any single entity can steer outcomes alone.
2. **DV-Light (guardians)** — a track for **subject-matter individuals** (including **two AI governance agents**) who weigh in where they have expertise; the community can **retro-fund** good work on-chain.

**Illustrative delegates in DV 5** (alphabetical, examples):
* **DV-DAOs:** Le Nexus, Permanence DAO, Polkadot Poland DAO, REEEEEEEEEE DAO, Saxemberg, Trustless Core, PBA Alumni Voting DAO.
* **DV-Light / Guardians:** Cybergov (AI agents), GoverNoun AI (AI agent), Daniel Olano, Flez, The White Rabbit.

> Context: In mid-2025, community discussions explored retuning the program. As of **September 2025**, **Cohort 5 is active** with the structure above.

## Polkadot OpenGov: Multi-role delegation

OpenGov lets you **delegate different tracks to different delegates** (e.g., a technical DAO for “Root,” an economic team for “Treasury”). This **multi-role** (track-level) model is the cornerstone of efficient participation without voting on every single referendum yourself.

**Why it matters:**

* **Granular control:** Fine-tune who represents you on each track.
* **Better signal:** Assign specialists where they credibly add value.
* **Flexibility:** Change or revoke any track’s delegation at any time.

## How DV fits with DAOs on Polkadot
* **DV formalizes delegation** to vetted entities (increasingly **DAOs**), encouraging **team-based due diligence**, **published rationales**, and **recusals** on conflicts.
* **DAOs** are often better than individuals at **24/7 coverage**, **conflict checks**, and **institutional memory** (tracking previous votes, treasury history, related referenda threads).
* **Power users** can still **override** any delegate by voting directly on a referendum (your direct vote supersedes your delegation for that item).

## Minn-guide: Delegate to a DV DAO in 10 minutes
**Goal:** Delegate Treasury-related votes to a DV DAO and Root-track votes to a technical delegate.

1. **Choose your delegates**

   * Shortlist one **DV DAO** for **Treasury** and one **technical delegate** for **Root**. Skim their stances and past rationales.

2. **Open your preferred governance portal**

   * Use a portal that supports **Delegation** for **Polkadot**. Connect your wallet.

3. **Delegate by track**

   * Select **Treasury** track → choose the **DV DAO** → set **amount** and **conviction** (e.g., 1× for agility; higher × = longer lock + more weight). Confirm.
   * Select **Root** track → choose **technical delegate** → set **amount** and conviction. Confirm.

4. **(Optional) Use Polkadot-JS UI for advanced toggles**

   * Navigate to governance → **Delegate** to fine-tune parameters, or delegate to **all tracks** first, then edit track-by-track.

5. **Monitor & override as needed**

   * If a specific referendum matters to you, **vote directly**; your direct vote overrides the delegation on that item. Track votes + rationales in the forum discussion views.

6. **Review quarterly**

   * Revisit track assignments, conviction locks, and whether your delegates continue to publish timely rationales.

## Example checklist: Due diligence on a DV DAO
* **Track record:** Do they publish **clear Aye/Nay/Abstain rationales** consistently?
* **Specialization fit:** Does their stated scope match the **tracks** you’ll delegate? (e.g., Treasury vs Root)
* **Conflicts & recusals:** Do they disclose conflicts and recuse when relevant?
* **Team composition:** Is it truly a **DAO** with coverage across time zones and skills?
* **Ops hygiene:** Multisig, identity, signing discipline, voting on time?
* **Community feedback:** Are concerns addressed promptly (e.g., public contact channel; community flags)?

## Common pitfalls & pro tips
**Pitfalls**
* **One-delegate-for-everything:** You lose the benefits of **multi-role** specialization.
* **Ignoring conviction locks:** Higher conviction boosts weight but locks funds longer—plan liquidity.
* **Set-and-forget:** Delegates change stance or capacity; review quarterly.
* **No conflict checks:** Look for declared recusals; lack of them is a red flag.

**Pro tips**
* **Mix entities:** Combine **one DV DAO** (Treasury) + **one technical delegate** (Root) + **one regional DAO** (People/Community tracks).
* **Override on criticals:** Use your **direct vote** for high-impact referenda; it supersedes delegation.
* **Follow the meta:** DV program updates explain guardrails and evolving norms—skim each cohort’s summary.
