A single, curated home for the best **Polkadot lectures**, **JAM protocol deep dives**, and hands-on workshops—from foundational 101s to advanced research talks. Filter by topic, depth, date, and materials to get exactly the session you need.

## Why this page exists
Polkadot education is scattered across conferences, meetups, and research seminars. This page gives you a **clean, filterable library** so you can learn faster, link confidently, and share reliably with your team or community.

**What you’ll find here**
* Rigorous **protocol lectures** (relay chain, parachains, XCMP, OpenGov, Asset Hub)
* **JAM protocol** deep dives and implementation updates
* Practical **workshops** (ink!, Substrate, tooling, benchmarking)
* **University & research** seminars for advanced readers
* Session pages with **slides, transcript, and chapter timestamps** when available

## How to use this library
1. **Pick a topic:** JAM, Relay Chain, Parachains, XCMP, OpenGov, Asset Hub, Bridges, Security/Cryptography, Tooling.
2. **Choose a depth:** 101 (intro), 201 (builder), 301+ (advanced), Research.
3. **Refine by format & date:** Keynote, Lecture, Workshop, Panel, Seminar; filter by month/year.
4. **Open the lecture card:** Scan the abstract, duration, chapter markers, and materials.
5. **Save or share:** Copy the reference, add to your watchlist, or share with your team.

> Tip: New to Polkadot? Start with the **Onboarding Essentials** collection (101), then move into **Builder Tracks** (201) for practical architectures and demos.

## Collections
* **Onboarding Essentials (101):** Core concepts, mental models, ecosystem overview.
* **Builder Tracks (201):** Patterns for app builders—where to deploy, how to integrate, real examples.
* **Advanced & Research (301+):** Architecture trade-offs, execution, scheduling, cryptography, performance.
* **Workshops & Demos:** Step-by-step sessions with repos, code walkthroughs, and benchmarks.
* **Governance & Economics:** OpenGov mechanics, treasury process, incentive design, audits.

## What’s inside each lecture page
* **Clear title & abstract** with topic and depth
* **Recorded date** (and publish date if different)
* **Duration** and **chapter timestamps** for key moments
* **Speakers & affiliations**
* **Materials**: slides, paper/notes, repo/demo, transcript (when available)
* **Version badge** if the lecture was updated after protocol/runtime changes
* **Related sessions** to keep learning

## Quality standards
* **Accuracy first:** We display the **recorded date** to reflect topical freshness.
* **Consistency:** Topic tags, depth levels, and formats are standardized.
* **Accessibility:** Captions and transcripts where available; readable abstracts and timestamps.
* **Neutrality:** Educational focus; no hype.
* **Versioning:** We annotate pre- and post-change talks when semantics evolve.

## Roadmap for learners
* **Newcomers:** Start with Onboarding Essentials → Parachains 101 → OpenGov primer.
* **Builders:** Jump to Builder Tracks → Workshops & Demos → Tooling (ink!, Substrate, PAPI).
* **Researchers:** Head to Advanced & Research → University Seminars → Performance & Security.
* **Governance contributors:** Explore Governance & Economics → Case studies → Monthly updates.

## Submission & curation
Have a lecture to add? Prepare: title, abstract, recorded date, duration, topic tags, depth, speaker details, and any materials (slides, paper, repo, transcript). We verify the metadata and place it in the right collection.

## Common pitfalls we help you avoid
* **Mixed dates:** We separate recorded vs. published dates.
* **Unclear depth:** Every lecture is labeled 101/201/301+/Research.
* **Missing context:** Abstracts and chapters highlight what you’ll learn and when.
* **Stale content:** Version badges warn when a talk predates major changes.

## FAQs
**What counts as a “lecture”?**
Keynotes, lectures, workshops, panels, and seminars focused on Polkadot or JAM protocol topics.

**How do I know the level?**
We tag every session: 101 (intro), 201 (builder), 301+ (advanced), Research.

**Are non-English lectures included?**
Yes. Language and caption availability are indicated on each card.

**Can I download slides or transcripts?**
If the publisher made them available, you’ll find them listed under Materials.

**How often is this page updated?**
We update continuously, with a monthly sweep to add new recordings and annotate changes.

**What if a concept changed since the recording?**
Look for the **Version** badge and the note explaining what changed.

**Is this investment advice?**
No. This is an educational library.
