## Polkadot Templates & Kits by Vertical
**Start fast with clear, ready-to-use materials for frontend UI, docs/education, marketing/launch, community, and governance.**
Pick a kit, copy what you need, ship something real. (Deeper dev/ops may come later.)

## Why this exists
Polkadot has many moving parts. You don’t always need a full stack—often a clean UI, a clear guide, or a lightweight launch plan is enough. These kits give you **only the essentials** so you can move without getting stuck.

**What’s inside (most kits)**

* Plug-and-play copy and page sections
* Lightweight UI blocks & page layouts (frontend-friendly)
* Checklists for “did we cover the basics?”
* Outline templates (threads, videos, docs, FAQs)
* Simple KPI sheets to keep score

> Governance and content templates will be **linked from here** (not embedded) to keep this page clean.

## Who it’s for
* Teams that want a **quick, clean frontend**
* DAOs/projects needing **docs, explainers, onboarding**
* Marketers & community leads running **repeatable launches**
* Educators/researchers assembling **simple demo stacks**

## How it works
1. **Pick a kit** below.
2. **Copy the parts** you need.
3. **Swap brand & links.**
4. **Ship a small release**, get feedback, iterate.
