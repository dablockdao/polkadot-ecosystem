Staking is an integral part of the Polkadot network, contributing to its security and decentralization. By staking DOT tokens, holders can earn rewards while supporting the network’s functionality. This article serves as a comprehensive **guide to staking DOT tokens on Polkadot**, exploring different staking options, how to select validators, and how to maximize staking rewards.

What is Staking?
----------------

Staking in blockchain networks, particularly those using Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms, involves locking up a certain amount of cryptocurrency to participate in the network’s operations, such as validating transactions and securing the network. In return, participants receive rewards, usually in the form of additional tokens. Unlike Proof-of-Work (PoW) systems, which rely on energy-intensive mining, PoS systems require participants to lock up their tokens, making them more energy-efficient and accessible.

Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Polkadot’s Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Polkadot uses a variant of PoS known as **Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS)**. In NPoS, t**oken holders can either become validators or nominators**. Validators are responsible for adding new blocks to the blockchain and validating transactions, while nominators support validators by staking their tokens in favor of specific validators. This system is designed to enhance network security and ensure that validators act in the best interest of the network.

Getting Started with Polkadot Staking
-------------------------------------

### Choosing a Wallet

Before you begin staking, you need to store your DOT tokens in a secure wallet. Polkadot supports a variety of wallets, including:

- **Nova Wallet:** A mobile based wallet with staking and governance features.
- [**Polkadot-JS**: The official web-based wallet with comprehensive staking features.
- **SubWallet** and **Talisman Wallet**: Browser extensions that provide easy access to staking.
- **Ledger**: A hardware wallet that offers enhanced security for your DOT tokens.

These wallets are listed on the official Polkadot website and are considered secure and user-friendly.

The Polkadot Staking Dashboard
------------------------------

Polkadot has introduced a new **Staking Dashboard**, simplifying the staking process. This dashboard is compatible with Ledger devices and does not require any browser extensions or third-party wallets. The dashboard provides an intuitive interface to manage your staking activities, including selecting validators, monitoring rewards, and managing nomination pools.

Staking Options on Polkadot
---------------------------

### Direct Staking

Direct staking involves **selecting validators and locking your DOT tokens directly on the Polkadot network**. This method requires a **minimum of 250 DOT** to submit an intention to nominate, but the actual minimum amount needed to earn rewards can **vary based on network conditions**.

### Nomination Pools

If you have fewer than the minimum amount required for direct staking, you can still **participate in staking through nomination pools**. These pools allow users to **stake as little as 1 DOT and earn rewards proportionally**. Nomination pools are an excellent option for those with smaller holdings who still want to participate in network security and earn rewards.

How to Stake DOT Tokens
-----------------------

### Step 1: Locking Tokens (Bonding)

The first step in staking is to bond your DOT tokens, which involves locking them on the network. This process can be done through the Polkadot-JS UI, the Staking Dashboard, or a supported wallet. Once bonded, your tokens will be locked for a minimum period (28 days on Polkadot) and will earn staking rewards.

### Step 2: Selecting Validators

Choosing the right validators is crucial to maximize your staking rewards and minimize risks. Polkadot allows you to nominate up to 16 validators. The network automatically allocates your bonded tokens to the selected validators based on an algorithm that optimizes for security and fairness.

#### Criteria for Selecting Validators

- **Era Points**: Validators earn era points for performing tasks on the network. Those with higher era points are generally more active and reliable.
- **Self-Stake**: Validators with a higher self-stake have more “skin in the game,” making them less likely to act maliciously.
- **Total Stake**: Validators with a balanced total stake (not too high, not too low) tend to offer better rewards.
- **Commission**: Validators charge a commission on rewards. Lower commissions mean higher returns for nominators, but a small commission ensures validators are incentivized to maintain high performance.
- **Identity and History**: Validators with a verified on-chain identity and a clean history (no slashes) are generally more trustworthy.

### Step 3: Monitoring and Managing Your Staking

Staking on Polkadot is not a “set and forget” operation. It’s important to regularly monitor the performance of your validators and make adjustments if necessary. Validators can change their commission rates or performance over time, and some may be slashed for misbehavior. Regularly checking your staking dashboard ensures that your stake is always working optimally.

Maximizing Staking Rewards
--------------------------

To maximize your staking rewards, consider the following strategies:

### Diversify Your Validator Selection

By nominating a diverse set of validators, you reduce the risk of all your tokens being impacted by a single validator’s underperformance or slashing. Polkadot’s system automatically distributes your stake across multiple validators, optimizing for security and reward potential.

### Participate in Nomination Pools

If you’re staking a **small amount of DOT**, joining a nomination pool can help you earn rewards that would be difficult to achieve through direct staking. Pools aggregate the stakes of multiple users, allowing them to act as a single large nominator.

### Reinvest Rewards

Reinvesting (or compounding) your rewards can significantly increase your staking returns over time. You can choose to automatically bond your rewards or manually reinvest them after claiming.

Staking Rewards and Risks
-------------------------

### How Rewards Are Distributed

Staking rewards on Polkadot are distributed per era (approximately 24 hours on Polkadot). These rewards are shared among validators and their nominators based on the validator’s performance during the era. Validators receive rewards for producing blocks and participating in the consensus process, and they share these rewards with their nominators after deducting their commission.

### Slashing Risks

Slashing is a mechanism designed to penalize validators (and their nominators) who act maliciously or fail to perform their duties. The severity of the penalty depends on the nature of the offense, ranging from minor fines to the complete loss of staked tokens. To minimize the risk of slashing, carefully select validators with a good track record and high self-stake.

### Unbonding Period

When you decide to stop staking, your tokens will go through an unbonding period of 28 days on Polkadot. During this time, your tokens will not earn rewards and cannot be transferred or used for other purposes. This period serves as a security measure, allowing the network to identify and penalize any malicious behavior before tokens are released.

Stash Account and Staking Proxy
-------------------------------

To enhance security, Polkadot allows you to use two separate accounts: a stash account and a staking proxy. The stash account holds the bonded tokens, while the staking proxy manages staking operations like nominating validators and claiming rewards. This setup reduces the risk of your bonded tokens being compromised, as the stash account’s private keys can be kept offline.

Advanced Staking Features
-------------------------

### Fast Unstake

Polkadot offers a “Fast Unstake” feature, allowing users to unbond their DOT tokens immediately if they haven’t backed any active validator in the last 28 days. This feature is particularly useful for users who accidentally bonded their tokens or if their nominated validators were never active.

### Chilling

Chilling is the process of stepping back from nominating or validating without unbonding your tokens. This can be done to avoid slashing during network issues or if you want to take a break from staking.

### Nomination Pools Administration

Nomination pools are managed by a set of roles, including the depositor, nominator, bouncer, and root. These roles handle pool administration, such as selecting validators, managing pool states, and setting commission rates.

Conclusion
----------

Staking DOT tokens on Polkadot is a rewarding way to contribute to the network’s security while earning passive income. Whether you choose to stake directly or through nomination pools, understanding the staking process, selecting reliable validators, and actively managing your stake are key to maximizing your rewards. By following this comprehensive guide, you can confidently navigate the staking landscape on Polkadot and make informed decisions that align with your investment goals.

Polkadot offers users a comprehensive staking dashboard to manage their staking activities efficiently. This guide provides an in-depth exploration of the functionalities available on the Polkadot staking dashboard, particularly focusing on creating and managing nomination pools, a critical feature for both pool administrators and members.

Managing a Polkadot Nomination Pool
-----------------------------------

Once a pool is created, administrators can manage various aspects through the dashboard:

1. **Claim Permissions**: Administrators can update claim permissions, allowing other users to compound or withdraw rewards on their behalf. Options include: 
  - Allowing only compounding.
  - Allowing only withdrawing rewards.
  - Allowing both actions.
2. **Commission Management**: The dashboard enables administrators to set and manage pool commissions. This includes: 
  - Setting the commission rate (up to 10% on Kusama and Polkadot, and 100% on Westend).
  - Defining a maximum commission to safeguard pool members’ interests.
  - Establishing a change rate and minimum delay between updates to ensure fair and predictable commission adjustments.

Pool Member Management
----------------------

Pool members can join pools and manage their staking within those pools:

1. **Joining a Pool**: Members can search and join pools by bonding their tokens. They can also enable permissionless claiming during the joining process.
2. **Claiming Rewards**: Members with permissionless claiming enabled can allow other users to compound or withdraw rewards on their behalf using external tools like polk.js apps.

Destroying a Pool
-----------------

Pool administrators have the option to destroy a pool when necessary:

1. **Initiating Destruction**: Administrators can set the pool to a destroying state. This action is irreversible and requires careful consideration.
2. **Unbonding Funds**: Administrators must unbond and withdraw funds for all members. This includes managing unbonding periods and ensuring all tokens are unlocked.
3. **Finalizing Destruction**: Once all funds are unbonded and withdrawn, the pool is officially destroyed, and its status is updated on the dashboard.

#### Conclusion

The **Polkadot staking dashboard** provides a robust platform for managing staking activities, particularly through its nomination pools feature. By offering detailed control over pool creation, management, and destruction, the dashboard ensures both administrators and members can participate effectively in the Polkadot ecosystem. This guide highlights the critical steps and features, enabling users to leverage the full potential of Polkadot’s staking capabilities.

Traditional Nominating of Validators
------------------------------------

Nominating validators is a core aspect of Polkadot’s Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS) system. In this system, nominators select validators who are responsible for securing the network, validating transactions, and producing new blocks. Here are some of the key aspects of traditional nominating:

- **Minimum Stake Requirement**: To become an active nominator, users must stake a minimum of **250 DOT**. Additionally, to earn rewards, the staked amount must exceed the **dynamic minimum active bond** (right now more than **500 DOT**), which can fluctuate based on network conditions.
- **Active Participation**: Nominating requires active participation, meaning that users must regularly monitor their selected validators to ensure they are performing well and not at risk of slashing. If a validator is slashed, all nominators backing that validator will lose a portion of their staked funds.
- **Governance Participation**: One of the advantages of traditional nominating is that staked tokens remain in the user’s account, allowing them to participate in Polkadot’s governance activities, such as voting in referenda and council elections.
- **Bonding and Unbonding**: Users can bond and stake their DOT tokens indefinitely. If they wish to switch validators, **they can do so without unbonding their tokens**. However, unbonding requires a 28-day waiting period before the funds become transferable.

Joining a Polkadot Nomination Pool
----------------------------------

Nomination pools offer a more accessible and less demanding way to participate in Polkadot’s staking system. With the introduction of nomination pools, users can pool their funds together and act as a single nominator. This approach has several unique features:

- **Low Entry Barrier**: The most significant advantage of joining a nomination pool is the low entry requirement. Users can participate with as little as 1 DOT, making staking accessible to a broader audience.
- **Simplified Process**: Unlike traditional nominating, joining a pool is more of a “set-and-forget” approach. The pool operator handles the selection of validators, reducing the need for constant monitoring and active management by individual members.
- **Rewards and Slashing**: Just like traditional nominators, pool members earn rewards based on their proportion of the pooled funds. However, if a validator supported by the pool is slashed, all members of the pool are subject to proportional slashing based on their stake.
- **Governance Participation**: Previously, one of the main drawbacks of joining a nomination pool was the inability to participate in governance activities with staked funds. However, a recent update has introduced the *“Delegate and Stake”* strategy, **allowing nomination pool members to participate in Polkadot’s OpenGov while keeping their funds in the pool**. This update marks a significant enhancement in the utility of nomination pools, empowering a larger segment of the Polkadot community to have a say in governance decisions.
- **Bonding and Unbonding**: Similar to traditional nominating, unbonding from a nomination pool requires a 28-day waiting period. Additionally, users must unbond all their staked funds before switching to a different pool.

The New “Delegate and Stake” Strategy
-------------------------------------

The introduction of the “***Delegate and Stake***” strategy represents a pivotal advancement in the Polkadot ecosystem. **Under this new approach, funds staked in a nomination pool remain in the member’s account**, allowing them to delegate their staking rights to the pool while retaining ownership of their funds. This strategy not only preserves the **user’s ability to participate in Polkadot governance** but also simplifies the staking process, making it more user-friendly and secure.

This update is currently being tested on Westend, [**Polkadot’s test network**](https://dablock.com/polkadot-testnets/), with plans for deployment on the main network in early August 2024. The transition to this new system is expected to be seamless for most users, with detailed guides available for those who need to take additional steps to ensure a successful migration.

How to Join a Polkadot Nomination Pool
--------------------------------------

To join a nomination pool on Polkadot, several tools can streamline the process and enhance your experience. The [**Polkadot Staking Dashboard**](https://dablock.com/dapps/polkadot-staking-dashboard/) offers a user-friendly interface, allowing you to easily manage your staking activities, track rewards, and join pools with just a few clicks. For mobile users, the [**Nova Wallet**](https://dablock.com/dapps/nova-wallet/) provides a secure and convenient way to **interact with Polkadot’s staking system**, including the ability to join nomination pools on the go. Additionally, [**Polkadot.js**](https://dablock.com/dapps/polkadotjs/) offers a more advanced, web-based interface for users who prefer a granular level of control over their staking operations, including joining pools, managing proxy accounts, and configuring staking preferences. These tools collectively make participating in Polkadot’s staking system more accessible and efficient, catering to both novice and experienced users.

#### Conclusion

Polkadot’s staking system offers flexibility through traditional nominating and nomination pools, each with its own set of advantages. Traditional nominating is ideal for users with a significant amount of DOT who are willing to actively manage their stakes and participate in governance. On the other hand, **nomination pools provide an easier and more accessible way to earn staking rewards with a lower entry barrier**, now with the added benefit of participating in governance activities.

As the Polkadot ecosystem continues to evolve, the introduction of the “***Delegate and Stake***” strategy underscores the platform’s commitment to decentralization and community involvement, ensuring that all members have the opportunity to contribute to the network’s future.
