Your single entry point to every guide we publish about Polkadot—wallets, staking, Asset Hub, DeFi, OpenGov, smart contracts, tooling, and JAM. Skimmable intros, step-by-steps, checklists, and FAQs so you can ship faster with fewer mistakes.

## Start Here
Polkadot evolves quickly. Terms change, runtimes upgrade, and tooling moves. This hub keeps the **latest, canonical** guides in one place—curated for builders, power users, and researchers. Every guide pairs a fast “do this now” path with deeper context when you need it.

## What You’ll Find (ELI5)
* **Do**: concrete tutorials (stake DOT, launch a token, open LPs, post a proposal).
* **Build**: developer patterns (ink!/EVM, SDKs, local forks, CI).
* **Understand**: architecture explainers (Relay Chain, parachains, XCMP/HRMP, JAM).
* **Decide**: comparisons, checklists, and pitfalls to avoid expensive mistakes.

## Guide Pillars
* **Fresh & precise**: 2025 terms and flows (Polkadot, Relay Chain, parachains, Asset Hub, OpenGov, JAM).
* **Skimmable depth**: ELI5 → quick start → deep dive → checklist → FAQs.
* **Action-first**: step-by-steps with screenshots and real transaction flows.
* **Interlinked**: each guide routes you to the “next right thing” to do.
* **Clarity & safety**: plain language, explicit risks; no investment advice.

## FAQs
**Is this hub for beginners or advanced users?**
Both. Every guide starts simple, then unlocks deeper context, patterns, and trade-offs.

**Do I need a hardware wallet?**
If you hold meaningful value or run team ops, yes—treat it as baseline hygiene.

**Which is better: ink! or EVM?**
It depends on your team. ink! offers native ergonomics; EVM offers familiarity and speed. Many teams prototype in EVM and later optimize with ink!.

**How risky is liquid staking?**
You gain flexibility and composability, but add smart-contract and liquidity risks. Start small, understand redemption paths, and monitor liquidity.

**What makes a strong OpenGov proposal?**
Clear problem, measurable milestones, transparent budget, auditability, and a delivery plan. Share drafts early for feedback before going on-chain.

**How do I keep up with changes?**
Revisit key guides monthly. We include version notes and highlight breaking changes.

**Can I reuse these checklists internally?**
Yes. Copy them into your runbooks/Notion and adapt to your workflows.

**Is any of this investment advice?**
No. Educational content only. Always assess your own risks.
