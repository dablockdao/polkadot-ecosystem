A practical, expert guide to creating and operating **Polkadot multisig** accounts—when to use them, how they work with **pure proxies**, and how today’s leading tools compare (**Talisman Signet / Polkadot Multisig by Signet, ChainSafe MultiX, Mimir, Nova Spektr, PolkaSafe**). Includes step-by-step flows, pitfalls, FAQs, and JSON-LD.

## Why Polkadot multisigs matters
**Problem:** Teams need shared control over funds (treasury ops, grants, bounties, DAO treasuries) without a single point of failure.
**Benefit:** A **multisig** requires a preset number of signers to approve a transaction. On Polkadot, multisigs are **native** (Substrate pallets), composable with **proxies**, and can safely interact with governance, staking, and dApps.

## ELI5: Multisig & pure proxies
* **Multisig** = a shared wallet: *“2 of 3 people must say yes for money to move.”*
* **Pure proxy** = a keyless “puppet” account controlled by your multisig. It lets you **rotate members** or **change thresholds** by updating the controller (the multisig) instead of changing the public address you share with exchanges, partners, or grant programs. (Pure proxies are created by the **Proxy pallet** and managed by your multisig.) ([Parity Tech][1])

## How Polkadot multisigs work (under the hood)
Polkadot uses the **Multisig pallet** to coordinate approvals and dispatch calls from a **deterministic multisig address** derived from the set of signatories + threshold. Common functions:

* `asMulti` – submit/execute a call with approvals;
* `approveAsMulti` – record an approval by hash;
* `cancelAsMulti` – cancel a pending call (usually by the originator). ([docs.moonbeam.network][2])

The **Proxy pallet** lets an account (your multisig) act on behalf of a **proxy account** (e.g., a **pure proxy** with no private key). You can set proxy types (Any, Non-transfer, Governance, etc.) and delays to constrain what a proxy can do. ([Parity Tech][1])

## Tooling landscape (2025)
* **Talisman Signet** (and **Polkadot Multisig by Signet**, a free/light surface) — enterprise-oriented multisig workflow built on the native pallets; supports team processes and self-hosted options. ([talisman.xyz][3])
* **ChainSafe MultiX** — open-source UI that popularized **pure proxy**–first patterns for safer ops; backed by a Web3 Foundation grant. ([ChainSafe][4])
* **Mimir** — cross-chain, enterprise-style multisig app with integrations (e.g., SubSquare) and active Polkadot forum proposals; emphasizes templates, UX, and API surface. ([Polkadot Forum][5])
* **Nova Spektr** (desktop) — all-in-one Polkadot wallet with **multisig operations**, light clients, and Vault integration; docs cover supported networks and flows. ([novaspektr.io][6])
* **PolkaSafe** — multisig-focused app aiming to integrate multisigs into dApp workflows (Subsocial, Polkassembly, Astar staking dashboard, etc.). ([polkadot.subsquare.io][7])

> Governance UX often relies on **SubSquare**, which supports OpenGov flows and can be used via multisigs through these apps. ([wiki.polkadot.com][8])

## Step-by-step: Create a secure multisig with pure proxy
Below is a generic **2-of-3** pattern you can execute in **Signet, MultiX, Mimir, or Spektr** (UI labels vary slightly).

### 1) Prepare signers
* Each member loads their wallet (e.g., Talisman, Polkadot{.js}, Nova Wallet) and confirms addresses on the target network (Polkadot, Asset Hub, para).
* Decide **threshold** (e.g., 2-of-3) and **roles** (initiators, reviewers, executors).

### 2) Create a **multisig**
* Enter addresses of **Alice**, **Bob**, **Charlie** and set threshold **2**.
* Save the **multisig address** (deterministic from members + threshold). ([docs.moonbeam.network][2])

### 3) Create a **pure proxy** controlled by the multisig
* From your app, call **Proxy → createPure** for a new **keyless** account.
* Set proxy type (often **Any** for treasury ops; consider **Non-transfer** / **Governance** for tighter scopes).
* The **multisig** is recorded as controller of the proxy. ([Parity Tech][1])

### 4) Fund the proxy
* Send a small amount to the **pure proxy address** (fees + deposits).
* Keep the proxy as your **public receiving/sending** address; rotate signers by updating the **multisig**, not the proxy address.

### 5) Execute a transaction

* Build extrinsic **from the proxy**, signed **via multisig** (e.g., `asMulti`).
* Co-signers approve (`approveAsMulti`), final signer executes (meets threshold). ([docs.moonbeam.network][2])

> Need UI help? Signet, MultiX, Mimir, and Spektr each provide guided flows; see their docs/announcements referenced above. ([polkadotmultisig.com][9])

## Practical example: Treasury payout flow
1. **Curator multisig** controls a **pure proxy**.
2. Grantee invoices → curators prepare a **Balances.transferKeepAlive** call from the proxy.
3. Two curators sign (`asMulti` approvals), transaction executes, on-chain records show the proxy as origin with multisig approvals attached.
4. For **OpenGov**–linked operations (e.g., track participation), curators can interact with **SubSquare** using their multisig where supported. ([wiki.polkadot.com][8])

## Common pitfalls & pro tips
* **Forgetting Asset Hub replication:** If funds sit on **Asset Hub**, replicate your **pure proxy** pattern there; a proxy created on the relay chain isn’t automatically mirrored on Asset Hub. This has bitten projects in the past; follow community guidance. ([polkadot.subsquare.io][10])
* **Using overly-permissive proxies:** Avoid “**Any**” when unnecessary; prefer **Non-transfer** or **Governance** proxies to constrain blast radius. ([wiki.polkadot.com][11])
* **Timepoints & cancellations:** The **initiator** can typically cancel pending calls; track **timepoints** to avoid race conditions in UI flows. ([docs.moonbeam.network][2])
* **Signer rotation:** Put the **pure proxy** as your public address; when rotating members, edit the **multisig** (controller), not the proxy.
* **Index & batching:** When creating multiple proxies in one batch, remember the **index** parameter (often `0` otherwise). ([Parity Tech][12])
* **Desktop vs web UX:** Teams managing many chains and large ops often prefer **Nova Spektr** (desktop + light clients) or **Signet** enterprise workflows; choose based on operational model. ([novaspektr.io][6])

## FAQs
**1) What’s the difference between a “static” multisig and a “proxy-based” (flexible) setup?**
A “static” multisig sends directly from the multisig address. A **proxy-based** setup routes actions through a **pure proxy** controlled by the multisig—so you can rotate signers without changing the public address. ([Parity Tech][1])

**2) Can multisigs participate in Polkadot OpenGov voting?**
Yes—apps like **Mimir** and **Signet** provide flows and integrations with **SubSquare** to interact in governance via multisigs. ([Medium][13])

**3) Do I need a new proxy on Asset Hub?**
Usually yes if you want the same pattern there; **replicate your pure proxy** on **Asset Hub** as needed. ([polkadot.subsquare.io][10])

**4) Is Signet the same as “Polkadot Multisig by Signet”?**
**Polkadot Multisig by Signet** is a free surface powered by Signet; **Signet** also offers enterprise features and self-hosting. ([polkadotmultisig.com][9])

**5) Is MultiX still relevant?**
Yes—**MultiX** remains a respected open-source interface and helped standardize proxy-first patterns; its guides/talks are still useful. ([ChainSafe][4])

**6) Which desktop wallet supports multisig well?**
**Nova Spektr** provides multisig operations, light-client verification, and Vault integration in a desktop environment. ([novaspektr.io][6])

**7) Does PolkaSafe integrate with dApps?**
Yes—initiatives have focused on integrating multisigs into dApp workflows (e.g., Polkassembly, Astar staking dashboard). ([polkadot.subsquare.io][7])

**8) Where can I see the exact extrinsics?**
Refer to Substrate/Polkadot API docs for `api.tx.multisig.asMulti`, `approveAsMulti`, `cancelAsMulti`, and **Proxy** pallet calls. ([polkadot.js.org][14])

## Conclusion
Polkadot’s native **Multisig** and **Proxy** pallets give you secure, composable account architectures. In 2025, teams can choose between **Signet (and Polkadot Multisig by Signet)**, **MultiX**, **Mimir**, **Nova Spektr**, and **PolkaSafe**—all capable of robust, proxy-first operations.
