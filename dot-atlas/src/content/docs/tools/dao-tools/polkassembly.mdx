## Polkassembly: The 2025 Guide to Polkadot OpenGov‚Äôs Governance Hub
Polkassembly is the community hub for discovering, discussing, and acting on Polkadot OpenGov‚Äîcovering referenda, treasury, delegation, preimages, and more. This 2025 guide explains what Polkassembly is, how it works, and how to use it efficiently as a voter, delegate, or proposer.

## What is Polkassembly (and why it matters)
Polkassembly is a governance forum and dashboard used across **Polkadot** and **Kusama** (and many parachains) to bridge *on-chain* decisions with *off-chain* discussion. It centralizes referenda, treasury proposals, bounties, preimages, delegation, batch voting and analytics, making OpenGov participation more approachable for everyone.

On **polkadot.polkassembly.io**, you‚Äôll find top-level sections like **Discussions**, **Delegation**, **Batch Voting**, **Preimages**, **Treasury**, **Bounties**, **Referenda**, and **Community/Analytics**, plus a forthcoming **Klara** AI assistant aimed at streamlining governance research and Q\&A.

Polkadot OpenGov itself is Polkadot‚Äôs on-chain, transparent governance system. Votes and outcomes are recorded on-chain and auditable in real time; token holders create and vote on referenda, including treasury spending.

## ELI5: Polkassembly in one minute
Think of **Polkassembly** as Polkadot‚Äôs town hall:

* **See what‚Äôs on the ballot** (referenda, treasury, bounties).
* **Read the debate** (comments, updates, and links).
* **Delegate** your votes to someone aligned with your views‚Äîor **vote** yourself.
* **Track preimages** (the ‚Äúexact code/instruction‚Äù behind a proposal) to verify what‚Äôs really being voted on.

## Key features at a glance
* **Unified governance hub:** Browse referenda, treasury, bounties, and discussions in one place.
* **Profiles & wallet login:** Create a profile by connecting your wallet and signing a message; monitor your votes and comments.
* **Track-level delegation:** Delegate by track (e.g., Treasury, Admin) with stats for delegates and totals across DOT supply. As of **September 2025**, Polkassembly displays **\~439.39M DOT delegated** across **154 delegates** and **565 delegators** (figures fluctuate).
* **Batch Voting:** Vote on multiple items with a defined default and submit once‚Äîhandy for active voters.
* **Preimages explorer:** Inspect preimages, deposits, sizes, and status to validate the exact change being proposed.
* **AI assistant (Klara):** An emerging Polkassembly chat interface designed to help navigate governance (wallet connect UX live, functionality rolling out).

## How Polkassembly fits into OpenGov

OpenGov is Polkadot‚Äôs governance architecture: on-chain proposals become **referenda** and can be **delegated** by track; every vote is recorded on the relay chain. Polkassembly fetches on-chain data and enriches it with discussion and tooling that make participation simpler (e.g., preimages list, batch voting).

## When to use Polkassembly vs other tools
* **Use Polkassembly** when you need the *end-to-end governance workflow*‚Äîdiscover, discuss, delegate, and vote in one place; verify preimages; and watch treasury/bounty pipelines.
* **Use SubSquare** if you prefer its dashboards, notifications, or chain coverage; it‚Äôs widely deployed across substrate chains and actively maintained.
* **Use the Delegation Dashboard** when your focus is *multi-role delegation* UX across OpenGov tracks.
* **Use Polkadot-JS UI** for low-level control and raw extrinsics (power-user workflows).

## Step-by-step mini-guide
### A) Create a Polkassembly profile
1. **Connect your wallet** (e.g., SubWallet, Talisman, Nova, Polkadot-JS).
2. **Sign a message** to prove ownership; Polkassembly sets up a profile so you can comment, track votes, and receive notifications.

### B) Delegate your votes by track
1. Open **Delegation**.
2. **Pick a track** (e.g., Treasury, Admin).
3. **Choose a delegate** using their on-page stats; confirm amount/conviction.
4. **Submit** and verify on-chain. (Totals and delegate counts are visible on the page.)

### C) Batch vote efficiently
1. Open **Batch Voting**.
2. **Set default** (e.g., AYE/ NAY / ABSTAIN / with conviction).
3. Quickly **override** specific items if needed.
4. **Sign once** to submit a batch.

### D) Validate a proposal‚Äôs preimage
1. Open **Preimages**.
2. Copy the preimage **hash** and inspect deposit, size, and call arguments.
3. Cross-check the referendum referencing that preimage before voting.

## Practical checklist
* [ ] Wallet connected and profile set.
* [ ] Followed delegates you trust; reviewed their track records.
* [ ] Set a **batch voting default** for busy weeks.
* [ ] Verified the **preimage** matches the intent of the proposal.
* [ ] Subscribed to updates via your preferred governance app(s).

## Common pitfalls & tips
**Pitfall:** Voting without reading the **preimage**.
**Tip:** Always skim the call, deposit, and size to be sure the action matches the forum post.

**Pitfall:** Delegating to a single person for all tracks.
**Tip:** OpenGov supports *per-track* delegation‚Äîspread risk by track.

**Pitfall:** Transaction fatigue leading to missed votes.
**Tip:** Use **Batch Voting** with a default stance, then override exceptions.

**Pitfall:** Confusing off-chain narratives with on-chain reality.
**Tip:** Decisions are enforced *on-chain*‚Äîvalidate via Polkassembly‚Äôs on-chain data and Polkadot support docs.

**Pitfall:** Ignoring AI helpers.
**Tip:** Try **Klara** as it rolls out for quicker discovery and context.
