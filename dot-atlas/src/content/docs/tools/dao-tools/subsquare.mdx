## Subsquare: Propose, Discuss & Vote on Polkadot OpenGov

This expert guide explains how to use **Subsquare** to participate in **Polkadot OpenGov**—from finding the right track and reading context, to **voting, delegating, and clearing expired locks**. It also covers what’s new in 2025 (e.g., OpenGov track adjustments and DV dashboards), plus step-by-step workflows, pitfalls, and an at-a-glance comparison versus Polkassembly, Polkadot-JS, and Nova Wallet.

## Why Subsquare matters
OpenGov is where **DOT holders** steer protocol direction, treasury spending, and parameters. **Subsquare** is one of the two primary, user-friendly front-ends (alongside Polkassembly) that **monitors on-chain events** and gives you clean interfaces to **vote, delegate, discuss, and review track stats** across Polkadot and Kusama.

## ELI5: OpenGov + Subsquare
* **OpenGov** = on-chain democracy. You vote on **referenda** in different **tracks** (e.g., small/medium/big spender, treasurer, wish-for-change).
* **Subsquare** = the dashboard for that democracy. It displays **active & historical referenda**, comments, tallies, and lets you **vote or delegate** from your wallet with a few clicks.

## How OpenGov works (quick refresher)
* **Tracks & queues.** Proposals go to specific **tracks** (each with rules for deposit, consideration time, etc.). In **2025**, Polkadot approved an **adjustment to reduce the max number of “deciding” items** across several tracks, creating healthier queues and less fatigue. Expect more proposals to **wait in queue** until they have enough support to enter voting.
* **Conviction voting.** Lock DOT longer to **multiply your vote weight** (up to 6×). Locks unlock automatically after the conviction period or can be cleared when expired.
* **Direct vote or delegation.** You can **vote directly** or **delegate** to trusted community members. The **Decentralized Voices (DV)** program channels voting power toward public delegates and DAOs to broaden participation.

## What Subsquare does (2025 view)
* A **governance platform** for Substrate chains that **scans & normalizes on-chain governance data**, covering Polkadot, Kusama, and many parachains.
* Dedicated **OpenGov home** for Polkadot/Kusama: **active & historical referenda, tracks, stats**, whale views, and **DV dashboards** (e.g., cohort summaries, delegates, guardians).
* Wallet-based actions—**vote, delegate, and clear expired votes**—with guidance aligned to Polkadot’s support docs.
* Ongoing enhancements from the Subsquare team: **profile redesigns, identity tools, Asset Hub support, proxy support, Coretime UI, better search, bounties UX**.

## Key features in Subsquare
* **Tracks, Stats & Whales:** Explore **all tracks**; see **statistics** and **whale voters** to understand participation and influence.
* **DV dashboard:** View **Decentralized Voices** cohorts, delegates/DAOs/guardians, voting patterns and track coverage.
* **Subscribe to on-chain events:** Stay updated as referenda move across **Preparing → Deciding → Confirming**.
* **Vote & delegate from your wallet:** Connect SubWallet, Talisman, Polkadot.js, Nova, etc., to **cast votes, delegate, undelegate**, and **clear expired votes**.
* **Cross-ecosystem coverage:** Polkadot, Kusama, and numerous parachains (e.g., Acala, Centrifuge, HydraDX, Interlay, Phala).
* **Roadmap (2025):** **Identity & proxies**, improved **Coretime views**, **Asset Hub** support, and **search** improvements.

**Notes:** Polkadot support docs present Subsquare and Polkassembly as primary governance portals; Polkadot-JS remains a **power-user** option; Nova focuses on **mobile governance**.

## Mini-guide: Propose → Discuss → Vote in Subsquare
> **Goal:** Safely navigate a full OpenGov cycle using Subsquare and adjacent tools.

### 1) Discover the right place to act
1. Open **Subsquare** → **Referenda**. Filter by **Track** (e.g., Small/Medium/Big Spender, Treasurer, Wish-for-Change) and status (**Preparing**, **Deciding**, **Confirming**). Use **Tracks → Statistics** for context.
2. If you’re new to a topic, scan **comments** and any linked forum discussions for background.

### 2) Connect wallet
1. Click **Connect** and choose **SubWallet**, **Talisman**, **Polkadot.js**, **Nova** (etc.).
2. Ensure the account has **enough DOT** to cover deposits (when proposing) and a small fee for transactions.

### 3) Discuss (off-chain) before proposing
* Post or join a **discussion** to gather feedback and surface risks/alternatives. This improves pass rates and reduces churn.

### 4) Propose (on-chain)
* **On Polkadot**, many proposers still prepare **preimages** and submit proposals via **Polkadot-JS** (power-user UI). Some parachains expose **“New Proposal / New Preimage”** flows directly in Subsquare; check your chain’s docs.
* After submission, your item will appear in **the chosen track** and follow that track’s timetable and thresholds.

### 5) Vote (or delegate) in Subsquare
1. Open the referendum page → **Vote**.
2. Choose **Aye / Nay / Abstain**, set **balance**, and pick **conviction** (0.1× to 6× weight with longer locks). Sign the transaction.
3. Prefer not to micromanage? Use **Delegate** per-track to trusted accounts/DAOs (you can later **undelegate**).

### 6) Track outcomes, clear expired votes
* Watch the **tally** and **timeline**; when locks expire, use **Account → Clear expired votes** to remove locks in one batch.

## Practical checklist
* [ ] Read **track rules** and expected timelines.
* [ ] Check **queue pressure** (fewer “deciding” slots since 2025).
* [ ] Confirm **deposit** & **preimage** steps (Polkadot-JS if needed).
* [ ] Share a **clear problem statement** and **KPIs** in your discussion post.
* [ ] Before voting, scan **DV & Whales views** for extra context.
* [ ] After referenda finalize, **clear expired votes** to unlock DOT.

## Common pitfalls & tips
* **Mistaking tracks:** A small Treasury ask on the wrong track can stall in queue. Double-check **track fit** before submitting.
* **Ignoring queues:** With fewer “deciding” slots, under-supported items may **stay queued**. Warm up support **before** submission.
* **Forgetting conviction math:** A **6× conviction** vote locks longer—great for weight, bad for liquidity planning. Know your lock horizon.
* **Not clearing expired votes:** Locks won’t disappear until you **clear** them; batch this from Subsquare’s **Account** tab.
* **One-track delegation confusion:** You **can’t delegate** a track where you hold **non-expired votes**. Clear those first, then delegate.

## FAQs
**1) Is Subsquare an official Polkadot product?**
No—Subsquare is a widely used **ecosystem governance platform** maintained by an independent team; it supports Polkadot, Kusama, and many parachains.

**2) Can I both vote and delegate?**
Yes, but **not simultaneously on the same track** with non-expired votes. Clear expired votes first, then delegate (or vice-versa).

**3) Where do I submit new proposals—Subsquare or Polkadot-JS?**
**Voting/delegation** work great in Subsquare. For **submitting** on Polkadot, most proposers still use **Polkadot-JS** (preimage + submit). Some parachains offer “New Proposal” directly inside Subsquare—check your chain docs.

**4) What are “DV” and “Whales” tabs?**
DV = **Decentralized Voices** dashboards (cohorts, delegates, guardians). “Whales” surfaces large voters to understand influence patterns.

**5) Why is my proposal queued for long?**
Polkadot reduced “max deciding” slots in several tracks in 2025—expect **more queuing** and prioritize **pre-discussion & endorsements**.

**6) Does Subsquare cover Asset Hub / Coretime?**
The 2025 roadmap includes **Asset Hub** support and **Coretime** UI improvements in Subsquare.

**7) Is there investment or financial risk in voting?**
Voting uses **locks**; with conviction, DOT is locked longer. There’s no yield implied—this is **governance**, not an investment product.

## Conclusion
**Subsquare** is a fast, analytics-forward path to **act in OpenGov**: filter by **track**, assess **DV & whale context**, **vote or delegate**, and **clean up locks** post-vote. If you’re proposing work, use Subsquare for visibility and discussion, and Polkadot-JS for low-level submissions when needed.
