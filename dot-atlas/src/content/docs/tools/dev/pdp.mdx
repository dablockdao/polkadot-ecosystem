The **Polkadot Deployment Portal (PDP)** is a no-code, one-click solution for launching **Polkadot Native Rollups** on **Polkadot Cloud**. It abstracts away paraID reservation, genesis file generation, and core scheduling, enabling teams to ship a production-ready blockchain in minutes while inheriting Polkadot’s shared security, sub-minute finality, and seamless cross-chain interoperability.

## Deploy on Polkadot 2025

| Friction point          | Traditional path                                  | With PDP                                    |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Coretime acquisition**| Manual auction bids                               | One-click “Right Now” or “Next Cycle”       |
| **Genesis build & upload**| Local compilation, WASM hashing                 | Auto-generated by PDP backend               |
| **Security configuration**| Custom proxy logic                              | **Pure Proxy** model with least-privilege   |

By eliminating these hurdles, PDP lets developers focus on runtime design and product-market fit instead of DevOps.

## Polkadot Deployment Portal Key Features

### 1 One-Click, Fully Customizable Rollups  
Developers choose between **Generic** and **EVM** runtimes—both **OpenZeppelin-audited**—or upload custom pallets. Upgrades remain **fork-free** via Polkadot-SDK.

### 2 Agile Coretime & Elastic Scaling  
Start on a shared core and graduate to dedicated blockspace each scheduling cycle, mirroring cloud pay-as-you-go economics.

### 3 Shared Security & Fast Finality
Rollups inherit Polkadot’s validator set, gaining < 1 minute irreversible finality without bootstrapping their own consensus.

### 4 Bridging & Interoperability 
Native **XCM/XCMP** messaging links every Polkadot Native Rollup, while **Snowbridge** and **Hyperbridge** provide trust-minimised routes to Ethereum and beyond.

### 5 Transparent, Competitive Pricing
The portal pre-calculates *reserved* (refundable) vs. *non-recoverable* fees, so teams know exactly how many DOT/KSM are required before signing.

### 6 Pure Proxy Security Model
PDP spins up a keyless **pure proxy**, briefly holds “Any” privileges to automate deployment, then hands full control to the project’s multisig. A fellowship proposal for a dedicated *ParaRegistration* proxy type will further tighten permissions.

## Deployment Workflow at a Glance
1. **Configure Rollup** – fill token name, supply, decimals, SUDO address, runtime, and chain (Polkadot, Kusama, Westend, Paseo).  
2. **Reserve ParaID** – PDP signs the on-chain transaction via the pure proxy.  
3. **Generate Genesis (WASM & Head)** – off-chain build by the PDP backend.  
4. **Register Genesis** – on-chain upload; PDP’s “Any” proxy is revoked.  
5. **Onboarding Epoch** – relay chain validators verify the rollup (≈ 4 h on Polkadot).  
6. **Core Assignment** – shared or dedicated, according to schedule.  

**Time-to-first-block:** ~8 h on Polkadot, ~2 h on Kusama.

## Ecosystem Integrations Out of the Box
- **Hydration** & other AMMs for instant liquidity  
- **WalletConnect**, Nova, Talisman, SubWallet support  
- Listings on CEXs (Binance, Kraken, MEXC) via **Polkadot Hub**  
- Funding routes: **Web3 Foundation grants**, **Polkadot Treasury**, VC bounties

## Takeaways
- **Polkadot Deployment Portal** delivers *one-click rollup deployment* for *Polkadot Native Rollups*.  
- Leverage **Agile Coretime** to *scale blockspace on demand* and pay only for what you use.  
- Gain **shared security**, **fast finality**, and *trust-minimised bridges* like **Snowbridge** & **Hyperbridge**.  
- **OpenZeppelin-audited runtimes** plus **forkless upgrades** accelerate shipping and iteration.
