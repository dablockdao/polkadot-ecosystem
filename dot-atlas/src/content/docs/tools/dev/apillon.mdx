## Apillon: Easy APIs & Prebuilt Solutions for Fast dApp Creation on Polkadot
**Short summary:**
Apillon is a developer platform that abstracts Polkadot’s complexity into simple APIs, SDKs, and prebuilt templates (“Simplets”). It bundles decentralized storage, hosting, NFTs, authentication/DID, embedded wallets (EVM + Substrate), cloud functions, and more—so product teams can ship Polkadot apps in days, not months.


## Why Apillon (and when to use it)
Polkadot gives you shared security, XCM interoperability, and Asset Hub primitives—but turning that into a user-ready product requires glue code: wallets, storage, deployment pipelines, NFT infra, auth, and compute. **Apillon** ships those as **modular services + SDKs** with a consistent developer experience, tightly integrated with Polkadot parachains (Moonbeam, Astar, Unique, Asset Hub, KILT, Phala, etc.). Use it when you want:
* **Speed:** One SDK for storage, hosting, NFTs, identity, embedded wallets, and cloud functions.
* **Polkadot-native UX:** **Embedded wallets** are **Substrate-ready**, so users can onboard with email/passkeys and get non-custodial wallets for EVM *and* Substrate chains.
* **No-code campaign kits:** **Simplets** for brand/event NFT drops (email/QR/open links), auto-deployed on decentralized infra.
* **LLM/agent automation:** A hosted MCP server exposes Apillon functions (hosting/storage/NFTs) to tools like GPT—great for ops and CI assistants.

## ELI5
Think of Apillon as **Firebase for Polkadot**, but decentralized:

* **Files & sites** → IPFS/Crust + decentralized hosting.
* **NFTs** → Wizards + SDK for Moonbeam/Astar/Unique (ERC-721/6059, PSP-34, Unique).
* **Login** → KILT-based decentralized identity (DID + credentials via OAuth).
* **Wallets** → Invisible, audited, **non-custodial embedded wallets** for EVM & Substrate.
* **Compute** → Decentralized **Cloud Functions** for bots, webhooks, and scheduled tasks.

## How Apillon Works
Apillon groups Web3 capabilities into services, each with a **dashboard, REST API, and SDK** modules. You provision a project, mint API keys, then call services from your app/CI or via the console/CLI.

* **Unified SDK** (`@apillon/sdk`): Hosting, Storage (with IPNS), NFTs (EVM + Substrate), Identity (KILT), Cloud Functions, Social, RPC helpers.
* **Developer surfaces**: Dashboard, CLI, JavaScript SDK, Flutter SDK, Go Storage SDK.
* **Agent surface (MCP)**: Hosted MCP server exposes Apillon functions to LLM tools for scripted ops (e.g., “upload and deploy site”).

## Key Services (with Polkadot specifics)

### 1) Storage (IPFS/Crust + IPNS)
* Create buckets, upload folders/files, pin to IPFS; generate IPFS links; manage **IPNS** names for mutable content pointers.

### 2) Decentralized Hosting
* CI-style flow: upload → stage → promote to prod, backed by decentralized web hosting (CDN + IPFS pinning).

### 3) NFTs (Moonbeam, Astar, Unique)
* Wizard + SDK for EVM (**ERC-721/6059**) and Substrate (**PSP-34**, **Unique native**). Drag-and-drop metadata/media; drops; royalties; soulbound/revokable options; React/Vue templates.

### 4) Web3 Authentication / DID (KILT)
* Email-verified **KILT DIDs** + verifiable credentials (attested issuers). OAuth pop-up returns a token your app can verify. Revocation & restore flows included.

### 5) **Embedded Wallets** (EVM + Substrate)
* **Invisible, non-custodial**, audited; created at sign-in (email/passkey). Uses confidential compute/MPC patterns; **Substrate-compatible** for Polkadot accounts. Demo flows available.

### 6) Cloud Functions (decentralized serverless)
* Deploy JS/Node scripts as on-demand/cron jobs to a decentralized compute network, with encrypted secrets, health checks, and auto-redeploy. Great for bots, webhooks, indexers, or off-chain workers.

### 7) Asset Hub guidance
* Docs cover **sufficient vs non-sufficient assets**, reserve-backed transfers, and multisig/proxy patterns—useful when modeling tokens on Polkadot **Asset Hub**.

## Simplets: Plug-and-play NFT campaigns
**Simplets** are prebuilt, customizable campaign templates—**Brand Booster**, **Event Experience**, and **NFT Wild West**—that ship with admin panels, email/QR/open-link distribution, and **embedded wallet** onboarding. Frontends deploy on Apillon Hosting; backends can run on decentralized compute. Open-source **NFT Studio** monorepo patterns are available.

*Interpretation:* If your goal is **Polkadot-native apps with friendly onboarding**, Apillon reduces integrations from 5–8 vendors to **one** (and is the only option here with **Substrate-ready embedded wallets** plus decentralized storage/hosting and KILT-based auth).

## Step-by-Step: Launch a Polkadot dApp with Apillon
### 0) Project setup
1. Create an Apillon project; generate API keys with least-privilege scopes.
2. `npm i @apillon/sdk` (Node 20+, npm 10+).

### 1) Ship your static app (decentralized hosting)
```js
import { Hosting, LogLevel, DeployToEnvironment } from '@apillon/sdk';

const hosting = new Hosting({ key: process.env.APILLON_API_KEY, secret: process.env.APILLON_API_SECRET, logLevel: LogLevel.INFO });
const webpage = hosting.website('YOUR_WEBSITE_UUID');

await webpage.uploadFromFolder('./dist');
await webpage.deploy(DeployToEnvironment.TO_STAGING);
await webpage.deploy(DeployToEnvironment.TO_PRODUCTION);
```

### 2) Store assets on IPFS with IPNS pointer
```js
import { Storage, LogLevel } from '@apillon/sdk';
const storage = new Storage({ key: process.env.APILLON_API_KEY, secret: process.env.APILLON_API_SECRET, logLevel: LogLevel.INFO });

const bucket = await storage.createBucket({ name: 'public-assets' });
await bucket.uploadFromFolder('./assets');
// optional: create/update an IPNS record to a new CID
const ipns = await bucket.createIpns({ name: 'site-assets', description: 'mutable pointer', cid: 'Qm...' });
await ipns.publish('QmNEWCID...');
```

### 3) Add **Substrate-ready embedded wallets** to onboard users
* Trigger wallet creation at email/passkey sign-in; Apillon handles the crypto under the hood; you get a **non-custodial** wallet that works across **EVM + Substrate** targets.

### 4) Launch an NFT collection (Moonbeam/Astar/Unique)
* Use the dashboard wizard or SDK to deploy ERC-721/6059 or PSP-34/Unique native NFTs; store metadata on IPFS/Unique schema.

### 5) Add off-chain workers with **Cloud Functions**
* Deploy JS jobs on a decentralized network; configure secrets; schedule with cron (e.g., nightly sync, webhook relays, Discord bots).

### 6) Optional: automate with **MCP**
* Point your LLM tool to the **Apillon MCP server** to script deploys (“upload and redeploy my site” / “pin this CID and update IPNS”).

## Common Pitfalls & Pro Tips
* **Mis-modeling assets on Asset Hub:** Understand **sufficient vs non-sufficient**, reserve-backed transfers, and cross-chain accounting before minting.
* **Mutable metadata needs IPNS:** Pin IPFS CIDs for permanence, but use **IPNS** if you must safely update pointers later.
* **Wallet custody misconceptions:** Embedded ≠ custodial. Document key-recovery UX clearly.
* **Over-centralizing compute:** Prefer **Cloud Functions** for bots/jobs to maintain decentralization guarantees.
* **Skipping DIDs:** For regulated or multi-tenant apps, pair KILT **DID + OAuth** with role-based access in your backend.
* **Ignoring agents:** If your team uses AI copilots, wire up **MCP** early—great leverage for CI and content ops.

## FAQs
**1) Is Apillon only for EVM parachains?**
No. It supports EVM and Substrate, including Substrate-ready embedded wallets and NFT flows on Astar/Unique.

**2) Can I use KILT for login with my own app?**
Yes. Use Apillon’s OAuth pop-up to verify a KILT DID + verifiable credential and receive an auth token in your app.

**3) Where are my files hosted?**
On decentralized storage (IPFS/Crust) with optional IPNS for mutability; sites deploy via Apillon’s hosting workflow.

**4) How are embedded wallets secured?**
Through modern MPC/confidential-compute patterns; Apillon never sees private keys.

**5) Can I run scheduled jobs without AWS?**
Yes—use **Cloud Functions** to deploy cron/on-demand jobs on a decentralized compute network.

**6) Do I get React/Vue templates for NFT frontends?**
Yes—starter templates are available (JS/Vue/React).

**7) Can agents (LLMs) deploy for me?**
Yes—connect to **Apillon’s hosted MCP server** and expose deploy/pin/mint flows to your agent.

**8) Does Apillon help with Asset Hub specifics?**
Docs cover sufficient assets, transfers, and multisig/proxy patterns which you can combine with Apillon services.

## Conclusion
If you’re building on **Polkadot** and want **fast, production-grade UX**—from decentralized hosting and IPFS/IPNS to **Substrate-ready embedded wallets**, **KILT DIDs**, **NFTs**, and **decentralized cloud functions**—**Apillon** is a compelling “batteries-included” path. Start with the SDK, ship a Simplet for growth, and wire agents via MCP to automate your stack.
