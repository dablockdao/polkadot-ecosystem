## Nova Wallet in 2025: New Features, How It Works, and When to Use It
Nova Wallet is a mobile-first, non-custodial wallet for Polkadot and Kusama. In 2025, Nova shipped major updates—multisig wallets, a Polkadot debit card (EEA), OpenGov voting with pool-staked DOT, smarter XCM transfers, Unified Address Format (UAF) support, and more. This guide explains what’s new, why it matters, and how to use Nova Wallet safely and effectively.

## What is Nova Wallet (and who it’s for)
Nova Wallet is an iOS/Android, **self-custodial** Polkadot wallet built by Novasama Technologies. It supports DOT/KSM and parachain assets, governance, staking, XCM transfers, DApps, NFTs, and hardware wallets—optimized for mobile.

**Best for:** mobile-first DOT users, nominators/pool stakers, DAO treasurers who want multisig, and DeFi users who need reliable XCM routing.

**Not ideal for:** users who need a desktop browser extension (Nova is mobile-only; consider SubWallet on desktop).

## ELI5: Nova Wallet in one minute
Think of Polkadot as many blockchains that talk to each other. Nova is your **phone app** that:

* keeps your keys offline (non-custodial),
* lets you **stake** DOT easily (even from small amounts via pools),
* vote in **OpenGov**, even if your DOT is pool-staked,
* move tokens between chains using **XCM** with safety checks,
* connect to **DApps** (DeFi, NFTs),
* and—new—use a **debit card** (EEA) funded with DOT for real-world spending.

## What’s new in 2025 (at a glance)
* **Multisig wallets** (discover/create/sign; HW wallet & proxies) in the 10.1.x line.
* **Nova x Mercuryo Polkadot debit card** (EEA): fund with DOT; Apple/Google Pay.
* **OpenGov with pool-staked tokens** supported (runtime change + Nova client updates).
* **Cross-chain (XCM) auto-route detection & pre-flight simulation** to avoid trapped assets.
* **Unified Address Format (UAF)** support alongside legacy addresses during transition.
* **Price charts** in-app; **sell tokens** via providers; **Ledger EVM support**; **KodaDot NFTs on Asset Hub**.

## Key features explained
### Staking (direct & pools) + OpenGov with pool-staked DOT
Nova offers **direct staking** and **nomination pools**, enabling staking from small amounts via pools with simple flows. With recent Polkadot runtime updates and Nova client support, **pool members can vote in OpenGov** without unpooling—so you don’t trade off yield for governance.

**Why it matters:** Stake small amounts and still participate in governance.

### Cross-chain (XCM) transfers: auto-routing & simulation
Nova introduced **automatic XCM route detection** and **simulations** to reduce failed deliveries (and “trapped assets”). If assets do trap, Nova provides recovery guidance using chain events, and its **XCM fee estimation** improves predictability.

**Why it matters:** Fewer failed transactions and clearer fees/routes across Asset Hub & parachains.

### Unified Address Format (UAF)
Nova supports **UAF**, providing both **legacy** and **unified** addresses during the ecosystem transition.

**Why it matters:** A consistent address style across chains reduces confusion and mis-sends.

### Hardware wallets (Ledger, Polkadot Vault)
Nova supports **Ledger** (Nano X/Flex/Stax via Bluetooth; some models via USB on Android) and **Polkadot Vault** (air-gapped QR signing), with clear pairing/signing flows.

**Why it matters:** Combine cold storage with mobile convenience.

### DApp Browser & EVM/Polkadot connectivity
Nova’s in-app browser connects to **Polkadot DApps** and many **EVM** DApps. A **Desktop Mode** toggle helps when a site isn’t mobile-optimized.

### NFTs & price charts
View **NFTs** across supported networks, and check **price charts** (1D–All) inside token detail screens. Nova also surfaces **KodaDot NFTs** on Asset Hub.

### Buy/Sell & off-ramp
Nova aggregates providers for **buy** and **sell** flows, making fiat on/off-ramping easier directly from the app.

### Multisig wallets
The 10.1.x release line adds: discover existing multisigs, create/sign transactions, and use **multisig with hardware wallets & proxies** (on Polkadot + Asset Hub, Kusama + KAH, Hydration, Mythos, Moonbeam, and more).

**Why it matters:** DAO treasuries and teams can manage policies securely on mobile.

### Nova x Mercuryo Polkadot Debit Card (EEA)
A **Mastercard-backed debit card** you **top up with DOT** in-app; works where Mastercard is accepted and can be added to **Apple Pay/Google Pay**. Availability: **EEA** (KYC required).

\* USB on Android only for certain models.

## Step-by-step mini-guide
**Goal:** stake DOT, vote in OpenGov with pool-staked DOT, send a safe cross-chain transfer—and optionally set up the debit card (EEA).

1. **Install & secure**
* Install Nova on iOS/Android, create/import wallet, **back up your seed** (offline).
* (Optional) Connect **Ledger** or **Polkadot Vault** for cold-signing.

2. **Stake DOT**
* Open **Staking** → choose **Pool** to start from small amounts or **Direct** for full control.

3. **Vote in OpenGov with pool-staked DOT**
* Open **Vote** → pick referendum → **Vote** (supported for nomination pool members).

4. **Cross-chain transfer safely**
* Tap **Send** → choose destination chain → review **auto-detected route** & **simulation** results → confirm. If funds trap, follow the in-app recovery guidance.

5. **Connect to DApps**
* Open **DApp Browser**, paste DApp URL (e.g., a DeFi appchain), enable **Desktop Mode** if the site isn’t mobile-optimized.

6. **Use the debit card (EEA)**
* **Assets → Manage Debit Card → Issue card**, complete KYC, top up with DOT, and add to Apple/Google Pay.

## Common pitfalls & pro tips
* **UAF transition:** when copying an address, Nova can show **unified and legacy** formats—match what the counterparty expects.
* **Destination fees & existential deposits:** ensure the destination chain will retain enough native tokens/ED after XCM; use Nova’s previews and fee estimates.
* **“Trapped assets” fear:** simulations reduce risk; if something fails, use the recovery flow referencing chain events.
* **Mobile DApps that look “broken”:** enable **Desktop Mode** from the DApp browser menu.
* **Hardware wallet models:** Bluetooth/USB support varies; check compatibility before large transfers.
* **Debit card geography:** the Nova x Mercuryo card is currently **EEA-only** and requires KYC.
