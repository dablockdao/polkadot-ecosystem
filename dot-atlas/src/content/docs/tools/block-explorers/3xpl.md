**3xpl**, short for “***3xplor3r***,” is a blockchain explorer designed to serve both regular cryptocurrency users and industry professionals. Developed by former members of Blockchair, 3xpl leverages years of experience to offer a super-fast and universal interface for exploring blockchain data. This platform stands out for its focus on simplicity, speed, and an ad-free experience, setting a new standard in blockchain exploration.

    - **Universal Format:** Ensures compatibility and ease of use across various platforms and services.
3. **Database Dumps**
    - **TSV Format:** Downloadable in Tab-Separated Values (TSV) format, these dumps are ready to be ingested into any Database Management System (DBMS).
    - **Universal Format:** Facilitates integration and analysis across different systems and platforms.
4. **JSON API**

## Blockchains Supported by 3xpl
3xpl supports a wide range of blockchains, offering extensive coverage across various networks. These include:
- **Mainstream Blockchains:** Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero, Dogecoin, and more.
- **Emerging Networks:** Aptos, Avalanche, Base, Beacon Chain, and many others.
- **Specialized Chains:** Polkadot, Cardano, Solana, Stellar, and others.

Each supported blockchain is provided with detailed data formats, including Main, Internal, ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155, and other specialized tokens.

## How 3xpl Stands Out
- **Speed and Efficiency:** 3xpl is designed to be significantly faster than traditional blockchain explorers, offering speeds up to 10 times higher across all services. This speed is crucial for both casual users needing quick transaction lookups and professionals requiring rapid data analysis.
- **Universal Data Format:** A key feature of 3xpl is its universal data format, which simplifies integration and use across different blockchains. This uniformity means that users can expect the same API output and data dump formats regardless of the blockchain, streamlining processes for developers and analysts.
- **Ad-Free Experience:** 3xpl's commitment to an ad-free experience ensures that users can navigate the platform without distractions, making it the preferred choice for those looking for a clean and efficient data exploration tool.
- **Limitations:** While 3xpl excels in providing a universal and fast platform, it does not process blockchain-specific data. This universalization can be seen as a trade-off, offering a more simplified experience but potentially less detailed than blockchain-specific explorers.

## Connection of 3xpl to Blockchair
3xpl is built by former members of the Blockchair team, leveraging their vast experience and knowledge. This connection ensures that 3xpl benefits from the lessons learned and best practices developed over years of work in blockchain data services. However, 3xpl takes a step further in terms of speed, universality, and user experience.

### Conclusion
3xpl represents a significant advancement in the field of blockchain explorers. Prioritizing speed, usability, and a universal data format, it meets the needs of a wide range of users, from cryptocurrency enthusiasts to developers and professional analysts. Its ad-free interface and support for a broad variety of blockchains further enhance its appeal, making 3xpl a valuable tool in the ever-evolving world of blockchain technology.
