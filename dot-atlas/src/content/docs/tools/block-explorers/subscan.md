**Subscan is a Substrate-based blockchain explorer and analytics platform** for such blockchains. It provides the searching and analysis of blockchain data by equipping users with a range of tools and data. Here’s what users can expect from Subscan:

1. **Block Explorer**: A block explorer that allows users to view details of the blocks, including transactions, extrinsics, and events carried out in this blockchain. These include the height, hash, timestamp of the block, events which have been triggered, and the extrinsics within it, up to a maximum limit of 1,000 records.
2. **Account Details**: Subscan can query account details of an address with its account balance, transaction history, and interactions it has with the smart contracts or features of the on-chain governance.
3. **Staking Information**: Subscan provides full-featured staking data for networks with a staking mechanism that secures network security, including information on validators, nominators, staking rewards, and slashes.
4. **Governance and Treasury**: Subscan lays out governance works, including proposals, referenda, treasury proposals to bounty programs. Users can track the status of governance actions in its totality from proposal stages, including ongoing and completed proposals, votes, and the results of these votes.
5. **Network Statistics**: This includes a variety of network statistics, such as total supply, volume of transactions, number of active accounts, among others. This helps in determining the health and activity of the network.
6. **Custom Queries**: Custom queries will allow advanced users to reach deeper into Subscan’s blockchain data. This use case is developed more for developers, researchers, and analysts who may need specific sets of data.
7. **Cross-Chain Data**: As a result of its strong attention to interoperability, Subscan also provides a set of tools to browse cross-chain data. Cross-chain data includes parachains (in the case of Polkadot and Kusama) together with their messages and transactions.
8. **User Interface**: The Subscan user interface is easy to use for both technical and non-technical personnel. The site has all the search and navigation placed on the platform for easier access to whatever the user might want to access.

Subscan serves as a valuable tool for anyone in the Polkadot ecosystem, **offering a potent window into the on-chain activities of Substrate-based blockchains**, serving not only developers but also investors, validators, and researchers of these networks.
