What is Subsquare?
------------------

**SubSquare is a governance platform, purpose-built for Substrate-based blockchains like Polkadot and Kusama**, seeking to enhance the governance process toward even more efficiency and better results.

**Key Highlights:**

- **Governance Simplified Participation**: It makes use of an intuitive user interface that makes it easy for comfortable voting for proposals, referenda, and council elections, reducing the barriers to entry to participation in governance.
- **Enhanced Transparency in Accessing Information**: This platform aggregates governance activities and assures the user is informed enough to be in a position to make an appropriate choice.
- **Community Engagement and Discussion**: Facilitates community discussion of the suggested ideas, thus allowing the creation of an enabling environment for reaching decisions by consensus.
- **Multi-Network Support**: It has been designed in a way that allows for the easy support of many Substrate-based networks, therefore becoming more useful throughout the Polkadot ecosystem.
- **Real-time Notification**: It ensures governance activity to keep updating the user through real-time notifications.

**SubSquare plans to streamline blockchain governance**, allowing even more approachable and transparent community participation in decision-making processes regarding decentralized networks.
