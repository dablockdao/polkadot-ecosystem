What is Dotreasury?
-------------------

**Dotreasury** is an online platform that provides comprehensive **tools for tracking and** **analyzing economic data and governance activities on the Polkadot and Kusama networks**. It serves as an essential resource for community members, validators, and developers within the Polkadot ecosystem, offering a deep dive into the economic and governance aspects of the network.

### Key Features of Dotreasury:

1. **Treasury Proposals and Spending**: Dotreasury tracks proposals for spending from the Polkadot and Kusama treasuries. This includes detailed information on submitted proposals, ongoing funding requests, and completed payouts, allowing users to see how treasury funds are being allocated and spent.
2. **Tips and Bounties**: The platform provides insights into tips and bounties within the network. Tips are voluntary payments sent to users for their contributions to the community, whereas bounties involve funds allocated for tasks completed by community members. Dotreasury allows users to track these transactions, providing transparency into community incentivization.
3. **Burnt Fees**: Dotreasury shows data on transaction fees that are burnt, which is part of the deflationary aspect of Polkadot’s economic model. Burning fees help regulate the token supply and economic stability of the network.
4. **Governance Participation**: It monitors and records governance activities, including council motions, referenda, and public proposals. This allows stakeholders to follow governance actions closely and participate more actively in the decision-making processes.
5. **Resource for Analysis**: By aggregating economic and governance data in an accessible format, Dotreasury serves as a crucial resource for analysis. This is valuable for stakeholders who wish to analyze trends, forecast network changes, or assess the impact of governance decisions on the network’s economics.

Dotreasury plays a vital role in enhancing transparency and accountability within the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems, supporting informed decision-making and active participation from its community members.
