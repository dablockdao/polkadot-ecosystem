Developed by [Mario Pino Uceda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariopinouceda/), PolkaStats aims to present live information from the Polkadot network in a human-readable format. This article explores the features, functionalities, and benefits of PolkaStats, making it an essential tool for anyone involved in the Polkadot ecosystem.

Introduction to PolkaStats
--------------------------

PolkaStats is a valuable resource for anyone looking to gain insights into the Polkadot network. Initially developed to display information from the Alexander testnet, PolkaStats has evolved to offer comprehensive statistics on the Polkadot mainnet. The platform is designed to be user-friendly, allowing users to easily navigate and access crucial data about validators, bonded funds, and network events.

Key Features of PolkaStats
--------------------------

### Active Polkadot Validators Rank

The homepage of PolkaStats prominently features a ranking of active Polkadot validators. This ranking provides several key details:

- **Total Amount of DOTs Staked**: This includes both self-bonded and nominated funds.
- **Validator Account Addresses**: Information on associated Controller, Session, and Stash account addresses.
- **Commission Rates**: The percentage of rewards taken by the validator.
- **Unstake Threshold**: The minimum amount of bonded funds required to maintain the validator status.
- **List of Nominators**: A detailed list of nominators for each validator.
- **Offline Events**: Information on any periods when the validator was offline.

### Detailed Validator Information

By clicking on specific links within the validator card, users can access more detailed information:

- **Nominators Link**: Expands or collapses the list of nominators for the selected validator.
- **Reported Offline Link**: Displays the list of offline events for the validator. Clicking on the block number associated with an offline event opens the block information page in PolkaScan, providing further details to determine the cause of the event.

### Favorites Tab

PolkaStats allows users to follow specific validators by marking them as favorites. The Favorites tab offers several functionalities:

- **Follow Validators**: Click on the grey star in the upper right corner of a validator card to follow it.
- **Edit Validator Name**: Customize the name of a validator by clicking on the “Edit validator name…” label, entering the desired name, and pressing Enter to save.

### Total Bonded Funds Daily Evolution Graph

A unique feature of PolkaStats is the daily evolution graph of total bonded funds for each validator. By clicking on the graph icon in the upper right corner of a validator card, users can view a graph tracking the total bonded amount of DOTs every 5 minutes. This visualization helps users monitor the performance of their validator and identify trends, benefits, and potential slashes.

### Additional Graphs in Development

PolkaStats is continually evolving, with weekly and monthly graphs currently in development. These upcoming features will provide users with more extensive data over longer periods, further enhancing their ability to analyze and understand validator performance.
