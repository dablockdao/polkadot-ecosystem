description: Smartphone-based cold-storage wallet. Turn your extra phone, tablet, or any other iOS or Android device into a hardware wallet.

The **Polkadot Vault app** is an innovative hardware wallet with software representation. That means i**t ensures that your phone, be it any iOS or Android device, gets transformed into a hardware walle**t in a safe and easy manner. The app then makes the management and storage of Katal Chain, Polkadot, Kusama, and most other Substrate-based chain tokens way more comfortable for the user by using repurposing devices that lay idle for cold storage.

### Key Features of Polkadot Vault:

- **Simple and Sustainable**: Convert a simple old smartphone or tablet that youâ€™re no longer using into a secure cold storage device without buying new hardware.
- **User-Friendly**: The app is simplistic in nature, with a very simple setup and application guide.
- **Security**: with the use of the System-on-a-Chip (SoC) as a secure element, all the private keys it derives are from physically generated entropy, and hence they will always remain confined to the limits of the secure element.
- **Multicoin**: The app is built to allow its users to access various coins, making it very reliable.
- **Offline Transaction Signing**: Allows for the start of transactions on the connected device and signing them with the Vault offline, therefore never exposing private keys.
- **Interoperability**: Polkadot Vault is designed to work perfectly with other wallets and services. With Nova Wallet, SubWallet, and Polkadot-JS, users can transact seamlessly across these platforms.
- **Wide support of tokens**: More than 175 different kinds of tokens are securely stored to make sure a wider range of assets can be managed through the app.
- **Open Source**: Users and experienced developers can review the code to understand how it operates, reaffirming its transparency and security focus.
- **Installation**: In order for one to set up a device with the Polkadot Vault, the person must first wipe the device to factory settings, download the app, and then set the gadget to Airplane Mode, keeping it permanently offline to maintain an impregnable air gap. Updating and adding new networks are performed by scanning an animated QR code without compromisation of the air-gapped security.
