The gateway to the Polkadot ecosystem.

What is PolkaGate?
------------------

PolkaGate, developed by the PolkaGate Foundation and funded by the Kusama Treasury, is a notable Polkadot wallet available as an open-source browser extension. It supports a wide range of DApps and tools within the ecosystem, emphasizing a non-custodial approach to wallet management.

This ensures that users retain exclusive access to their accounts, underscoring the importance of securing mnemonic phrases and backup files. PolkaGate supports various browsers, including Chrome, Edge, Brave, and Firefox, offering features like account creation and restoration, watch-only accounts, and connections to Polkadot Vault and Ledger accounts.
