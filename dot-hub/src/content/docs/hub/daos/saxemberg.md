**Saxemberg is a prominent player within the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems**, offering validation and collation services. Their mission revolves around fostering a decentralized and neutral blockchain environment, focusing on credibility, privacy, and regulatory compliance. Saxemberg stands out by ensuring their operations are transparent, **their hardware is hosted in independent data centers**, and by committing to never exploit blockchain consensus rules.

## Saxemberg Core Mission

At its heart, **Saxemberg aims to deliver top-notch validation and collation services**. They emphasize the security and reliability of their infrastructure, which is hosted in non-tech-conglomerate data centers with redundant energy sources and robust network connectivity. This ensures high availability and resilience against cybersecurity threats like DDoS attacks.

Moreover, **Saxemberg is dedicated to expanding its geographical presence**, prioritizing regions with strong privacy laws and favorable regulatory frameworks. This strategic approach not only enhances the reliability of their services but also aligns with their commitment to privacy and neutrality.

## Saxemberg Commitment to Ethical Practices

Saxemberg’s operational ethos is grounded in **ethical practices and transparency**. They pledge to keep logs for the minimum duration necessary, solely for cybersecurity purposes, and to never use these logs for surveillance or sell them to third parties. This strict privacy stance extends to their software usage, ensuring it is only employed as intended without exploiting it for profit through consensus attacks or other malicious activities.

Their **commitment to neutrality** is further reinforced by their refusal to join any DAOs, BORGs, or validator alliances that might compromise their independence. This guarantees that their actions remain free from outside pressure, ensuring a fair and unbiased ecosystem.
