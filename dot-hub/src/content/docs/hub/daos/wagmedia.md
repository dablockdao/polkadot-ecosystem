What is WagMedia?
-----------------

***WagMedia***, launched in December 2021, is designed to **simplify the marketing activities within the Polkadot ecosystem**. This initiative addresses the complex process of submitting treasury proposals on Polkadot and Kusama by offering **a streamlined way to reward marketing efforts**. It operates on *Discord*, allowing users to register their *Substrate* address and submit content, supported by funding from Kusama and Polkadot bounties and specific parachain marketing campaigns.

The platform not only helps users navigate the intricate Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems but also emphasizes the **creation and distribution of quality content**, including translations and dubs across several languages. This focus on diverse language support is crucial as it caters to a global audience, not all of whom may be proficient in English.

**WagMedia’s role in enhancing marketing awareness is vital for decentralized blockchains like Polkadot, Kusama, and its ecosystem appchains** such as Moonbeam, Acala, Bifrost, and Astar, as it helps to foster a more informed and engaged community.
