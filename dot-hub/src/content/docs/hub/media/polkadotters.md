**Polkadotters** is a prominent name within the Polkadot ecosystem, known for its multifaceted contributions as validators, collators, and an independent media house. Originating from **Czechia**, this group of enthusiasts has made significant strides since its inception in 2020, driven by a deep passion for blockchain technology and the Polkadot network.

### Early Beginnings and Evolution

**Founded by Petr**, a seasoned backend developer, **and** **Pavel**, Polkadotters emerged from a keen interest in the Polkadot ecosystem and its potential. Recognizing the absence of a localized community, they established the **first Czechia &amp; Slovak Polkadot community**. This initiative marked the beginning of their journey, which quickly expanded from community building to technical involvement in the Polkadot infrastructure.

**Polkadotters is a participant in the 1000 Validators Program and a founder of the [DOT Validator Alliance DAO](https://dablock.com/ecosystem/dot-validator-alliance/)**. They have also been active in assisting various projects to develop their collator programs. Their involvement extends to United Bloc DAO and the IBP program, underscoring their commitment to enhancing the Polkadot network’s decentralization and infrastructure.

Polkadotters operate multiple validators and collators across different parachains, including Kusama and Polkadot. Their validator names, such as Polkadotters/Shrimp, Shark, Whale, and Octopus, are well-recognized within the community. The organization prides itself on non-custodial services, ensuring that delegators’ funds remain secure and untouchable.

Quality of service is a hallmark of Polkadotters. They utilize top-tier hardware, maintain rigorous monitoring systems, and employ backups to ensure maximum uptime. Their focus on performance optimization typically places their nodes among those with the highest Annual Percentage Rates (APR) in the ecosystem. Currently, they operate two validators on Polkadot and one on Kusama, along with approximately 30 collators on various parachains.

Polkadotters reinvest their staking rewards into community activities, such as organizing conferences, publishing educational content, and promoting the Polkadot ecosystem. They have also taken steps towards sustainability by offsetting their carbon emissions through RM Terra.
