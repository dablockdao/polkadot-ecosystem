The Polkadot Blockchain Academy, founded by **Gavin Wood**, offers classroom-based education on blockchain technology using **Polkadot and Substrate**. It is led by experts from the Polkadot ecosystem, ***Parity Technologies***, and the ***Web3 Foundation***.

What is the Polkadot Blockchain Academy?
----------------------------------------

***Polkadot Blockchain Academy*** is a project of the **Web3 Foundation** structured to provide **specialized hands-on training in blockchain technology focusing on Substrate and Polkadot**. These are usually intensive training courses whereby one has an opportunity to be trained by some of the best developers in blockchain.

Usually, this is formatted in a modular manner and consists of a combination of theoretical and practical, including the coding sessions, the lectures, and the workshops. They may also **work on projects that could lead to real contributions within the Polkadot ecosystem**. Their mission is to provide capacity to attendees in order to be able to actively contribute to the **development of blockchain technology** and foster innovation within the Polkadot Network.

The initiative is part of a broader **educational effort by Polkadot to grow the base of developers in its ecosystem** and further enable those involved by giving them more comprehensive knowledge in how to develop on Substrate, including participation in Polkadotâ€™s governance and parachain development.
