Qoda Finance is a decentralized financial services platform that provides innovative DeFi solutions, including lending and borrowing, within the Polkadot ecosystem.

Qoda Finance: Revolutionizing DeFi with Decentralized Financial Services
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The financial world is on the brink of a transformation, driven by the power of blockchain technology and decentralized finance (DeFi). Leading this charge is Qoda Finance, a forward-thinking project within the Polkadot ecosystem that aims to democratize access to financial services. This article explores the intricacies of Qoda Finance, its DAO governance, ecosystem applications, and the innovative financial solutions it offers.

Qoda DAO: Decentralized Governance
----------------------------------

At the heart of Qoda Finance lies the Qoda Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), which oversees the entire Qoda Ecosystem. Membership in the Qoda DAO is granted to holders of $veQODA tokens, acquired by staking $QODA tokens. This membership allows individuals to participate in governance, voting on proposals that shape the future of the Qoda Ecosystem and its associated applications.

The Qoda Ecosystem: Partnering for Financial Inclusivity
--------------------------------------------------------

The Qoda Ecosystem is a collaborative network of partner applications dedicated to making top-tier financial services accessible to everyone. These applications, which can operate across various blockchain networks, embody Qoda’s vision of inclusive and efficient financial services.

### Current Ecosystem Applications

- **Threebalance**: A portfolio management tool designed for seamless rebalancing of crypto portfolios in three steps using on-chain liquidity sources. This application is owned and operated by Steadily Consulting Inc.
- **Qonstant**: An orderbook-style, fixed-rate lending and borrowing exchange on Arbitrum One, also owned and operated by Steadily Consulting Inc.

Qoda Ecosystem partners have the option to purchase $QODA tokens, which can either be burned permanently or distributed as rewards to Qoda DAO members. The amount and distribution method of these tokens are determined through agreements with each partner.

Qoda Finance Strategy and Vision
--------------------------------

Traditional financial systems, while successful in certain aspects, have often reserved the best financial services for the wealthy. Decentralized finance, empowered by blockchain technology, offers a more inclusive and accessible alternative. Qoda Finance envisions a decentralized future for the finance industry, aiming to bridge the gap between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi).

### Focus Areas

Qoda’s current focus includes on-chain asset management and credit markets, with plans to expand as new partner applications join the ecosystem.

$QODA Token: The Gateway to Qoda DAO
------------------------------------

The $QODA token, adhering to the ERC-20 standard, is integral to the Qoda DAO. With a fixed supply of one billion tokens, $QODA cannot be minted beyond this limit, although it can be burned as a deflationary measure. Both $QODA and $veQODA, along with their smart contracts, are native to Arbitrum One.

### Token Genesis Events

The Token Genesis Events for $QODA and $veQODA are scheduled from June 4 to June 7, 2024.

### Supply Allocation

- **Ecosystem Treasury**: 42% – Distributed based on governance votes.
- **Initial Staking Rewards**: 2.25% – Incentivizes DAO participation.
- **Community Rewards**: 3% – Encourages usage of Qoda Ecosystem Apps.
- **Liquidity Bootstrapped Pool**: 5.326% – Managed by Fjord Foundry.
- **Private Rounds**: 8.75% – Allocated to early investors.
- **KOL Round**: 1% – Key opinion leaders.
- **CEX Market Maker**: 3%
- **Corporate Treasury**: 14.674% – Funds operations and liquidity.
- **Core Team**: 20% – Incentivizes contributors and advisors.

Qoda Finance Trading and Taxes
------------------------------

### DEX Listing

The $QODA token will be listed on Uniswap (Arbitrum One) following the distribution of tokens to LBP participants.

### CEX Listing

Plans are underway for $QODA to be listed on reputable centralized exchanges (CEXes) in 2024, though the focus remains on enabling on-chain liquidity.

### Buy/Sell Token Tax

The $QODA token includes a configurable token tax, initially set at 0% for buys and 2% for sells, to be shared between Qoda DAO members and Steadily Consulting Inc. This tax can be adjusted through governance proposals.

### Liquidity Provision Tax Rebate

To address challenges in distinguishing between liquidity provision and trading transactions, a tax rebate system will be implemented post-TGE to rebate taxes collected during liquidity provision transactions.

Qonstant Protocol: Advanced DeFi Lending and Borrowing
------------------------------------------------------

Qonstant is a DeFi protocol on Arbitrum One that enhances traditional money market protocols. Key features include:

- **On-Chain Orderbook**: Facilitates lending and borrowing with transparent price discovery.
- **Isolated Collateral vs. Market Assets**: Segregates collateral assets from market assets.
- **Hybrid Borrowing Model**: Supports both overcollateralized and undercollateralized borrowing.
- **Fixed Interest Rate Loans**: Allows for fixed maturity loans with early exit options.
- **Repayment Redemption Ratio (RRR)**: Socializes losses in case of borrower defaults, ensuring fairness.

### Protocol Mechanics

Qonstant uses an orderbook mechanism similar to futures exchanges, where users can publish quotes for borrowing or lending at fixed rates and maturities. The system also supports flexible loan exits through qTokens, which represent claims on future cash flows and can be traded or staked.

### Conclusion

Qoda Finance stands at the forefront of the DeFi revolution, leveraging blockchain technology to create a more inclusive financial ecosystem. By combining innovative protocols like Qonstant with a robust governance framework through Qoda DAO, Qoda Finance is poised to redefine access to financial services, making them accessible to all, irrespective of wealth or geography. Join the Qoda Ecosystem and be a part of the future of decentralized finance.
