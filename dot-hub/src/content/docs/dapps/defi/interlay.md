Interlay is a DeFi platform focused on **bridging Bitcoin with Polkadot and other blockchains**, enabling Bitcoin holders to engage in DeFi without leaving Bitcoin’s security. Its core features and goals include:

1. **Bitcoin on Polkadot (InterBTC)**: Creates a 1:1 Bitcoin-backed asset, InterBTC, that’s usable across various blockchains, maintaining full collateralization and trustlessness.
2. **Decentralized and Trustless Infrastructure**: Utilizes decentralized vaults and a collateralized debt position system to ensure the security of Bitcoin assets on the platform.
3. **Cross-Chain Interoperability**: Leverages Polkadot’s technology to enable seamless Bitcoin movement across different blockchain ecosystems, enhancing liquidity and DeFi utility.
4. **Expands DeFi Opportunities for Bitcoin**: Offers Bitcoin holders access to lending, yield farming, and trading within the DeFi space while maintaining asset security.
5. **Community Governance and High Security**: Involves the community in governance decisions, supported by regular security audits and protective mechanisms like over-collateralization and insurance pools.

**Interlay aims to integrate Bitcoin into the DeFi ecosystem**, facing challenges like technical complexities, security assurance, and regulatory compliance. Its development signifies a step towards a unified, accessible DeFi landscape, enriching both Bitcoin’s utility and the broader DeFi domain.
