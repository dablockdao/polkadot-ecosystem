DeFi  
 Liquid Staking  

 A decentralized, non-custodial cross-chain liquid staking protocol.

What is Bifrost?
----------------

Designed with the Substrate framework, **Bifrost is a DeFi protocol that focuses on enhancing staking liquidity** and facilitating the transfer of assets cross-chain within the Polkadot ecosystem. Here are its key features:

- **Staking Liquidity**: Bifrost allows for staking cryptocurrencies and in return, users receive vTokens that represent their staked assets. These vTokens can be freely traded or used within DeFi protocols, solving the liquidity issue typically associated with staked assets.
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Acts as middleware, enabling the seamless transfer of assets across a wide range of blockchain networks, promoting interoperability and liquidity aggregation.
- **DEX and Yield Farming**: Bifrost features a decentralized exchange that provides yield farming opportunities, offering users additional utility and income from their staked assets.
- **Bifrost Native Token (BNC)**: The BNC token serves multiple roles within the ecosystem, including governance, payment of transaction fees, and distribution of rewards, granting holders decision-making power in the development of the network.

**Bifrost aims to create a** **unified DeFi ecosystem that breaks down the silos of blockchains**, thereby enhancing both the liquidity and utility of staked assets. This approach addresses challenges related to cross-chain transactions, security, and adoption, moving towards a more interconnected and efficient blockchain environment.
