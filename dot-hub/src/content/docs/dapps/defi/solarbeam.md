description: The native AMM of Moonriver and Moonbeam.
---

**Solarbeam is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform built on the Moonriver Network (SOLAR)** and **Moonbeam Network (FLARE)**, which itself is a part of the larger Polkadot ecosystem. It serves as an automated market maker (AMM), similar to Uniswap on the Ethereum network, but it operates within the Polkadot framework, leveraging the interoperability and scalability that Polkadot offers.

As an AMM, Solarbeam facilitates **decentralized trading, liquidity provision, and yield farming** without the need for traditional financial intermediaries. Users can swap between different tokens, add their assets to liquidity pools to earn trading fees, and participate in various yield farming opportunities to earn **SOLAR &amp; FLARE**, the platform’s natives token. The aim of Solarbeam is to offer a comprehensive DeFi experience with enhanced transaction efficiency and lower fees, thanks to the underlying Moonriver and Polkadot technologies.

Solarbeam’s integration into the Polkadot ecosystem allows it to benefit from **cross-chain interoperability**, enabling assets and data to move freely between Polkadot parachains and other blockchains. This creates a more unified and accessible DeFi landscape, where users can interact with a vast array of assets and services without being confined to a single blockchain.
