Zeitgeist is the next unique **prediction market platform built within the Polkadot ecosystem on the Substrate framework** and includes:

1. **Decentralized Prediction Markets**: Users will be able to make bets on all sorts of predictions regarding the future of events without central oversight.
2. **Futarchy-Based Governance**: Makes use of prediction markets for all governance decisions to achieve better outcomes.
3. **Cross-chain Interoperability**: It benefits from the ecosystem that Polkadot has, and therefore, it can reach out to many blockchains to have the widest reach.
4. **Customizable Market Mechanisms**: It presents an adjustable, dynamic market mechanism for the creation of various tailor-made prediction scenarios.
5. **ZTG Token**: Serves as the transaction fee, market participation, staking, and governance through the engagement of the community in building the platform.

Zeitgeist comes in with the potential to change the nature of making predictions and governance by the use of decentralized collective intelligence. Facing its own set of challenges—from user adoption to regulatory navigation—Zeitgeist commits to innovation and community engagement in making serious headway for times to come.
