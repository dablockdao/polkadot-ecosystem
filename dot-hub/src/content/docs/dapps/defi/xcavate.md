**Addressing Critical Challenges in Real Estate.** The global real estate market, valued at over **$378.7 trillion at the end of 2022**, represents the largest store of wealth across all sectors (*Source: Savills article by Paul Torstevin)*. However, a significant disparity exists, with nearly half of the world’s wealth owned by just 1.1% of the global population (*Source: Credit Suisse Global Wealth Databook 2021*). The complexity and need for trusted intermediaries in real estate investments often exclude average individuals from participating in lucrative opportunities.

Additionally, the real estate sector is a major contributor to global carbon dioxide emissions, accounting for **nearly 40% of the total emissions** (*Source: Forbes article by David Carlin Apr 5, 2022*). Of these emissions, 70% come from building operations, while the remaining 30% arise from construction activities. Furthermore, homelessness remains a pressing issue, with an estimated 150 million people worldwide lacking adequate housing (Source: The World Economic Forum website article by Patrick Henry Oct 2021).
