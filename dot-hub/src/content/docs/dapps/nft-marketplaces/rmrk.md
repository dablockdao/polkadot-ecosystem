NFTs  
 Standard  

RMRK is an advanced NFT protocol enabling dynamic, multi-functional, and interoperable digital assets across multiple blockchain platforms.

What is the RMRK NFT standard?
------------------------------

**RMRK is a cutting-edge NFT protocol** designed to operate across multiple blockchain platforms. Unlike traditional NFTs, which are often static and limited in capabilities, **RMRK provides a robust framework for creating dynamic and interactive digital assets**. This protocol supports the creation of complex, multi-functional NFTs that can evolve and interact with their environment.

As the NFT ecosystem evolves, RMRK distinguishes itself with **groundbreaking features** that offer unprecedented functionality and flexibility.

This article explores RMRK, its unique features—such as **nested NFTs**, **conditional rendering**, **multi-asset NFTs**, **composable and equippable NFTs**, **Soulbound 2.0**, **Emotable NFTs**, **ERC-20 Token Holder**, and **on-chain attributes**—and how it differentiates itself from other NFT protocols.

Unique Features of RMRK
-----------------------

### Nested NFTs

**Definition:** Nested NFTs allow one NFT to own other NFTs. This hierarchical structure enables the creation of complex assets where a parent NFT can hold multiple child NFTs. **Example:** In a game, a character (parent NFT) can own various items like weapons, armor, and pets (child NFTs). Each item can be traded or upgraded independently.

### Multi-Asset NFTs

**Definition:** Multi-asset NFTs can include multiple types of media or data assets within a single NFT. This allows an NFT to be represented in various formats and contexts. **Example:** A single NFT that can display a 2D image, a 3D model, an audio track, and a text description. Depending on the platform or application, different assets can be accessed and utilized.

### Composable and Equippable NFTs

**Definition:** Composable NFTs can be equipped with other NFTs, enhancing their functionality or appearance. Equippable NFTs allow specific parts of an NFT to be replaced or upgraded. **Example:** In a game, a character NFT can equip various items like swords, shields, and armor. These items can be swapped out or upgraded as the player progresses.

### Soulbound 2.0

**Definition:** Soulbound NFTs are non-transferable and are permanently bound to a specific wallet or NFT. Soulbound 2.0 introduces enhanced functionalities and conditions for these NFTs. **Example:** Achievements or certifications that are permanently associated with a user’s profile and cannot be transferred or sold.

### Emotable NFTs

**Definition:** Emotable NFTs allow users to attach reactions or emotions to NFTs, creating a more interactive and social experience. **Example:** Users can react to a digital artwork with emojis or comments, enhancing community engagement around the NFT.

### On-Chain Attributes

**Definition:** On-chain attributes allow dynamic data and properties of NFTs to be stored directly on the blockchain, ensuring immutability and transparency. **Example:** A game character’s attributes such as strength, agility, and intelligence are stored on-chain and can be updated based on the character’s progress.

### ERC-20 Token Holder

**Definition:** This feature extends NFTs to hold ERC-20 tokens, integrating fungible tokens within non-fungible tokens. **Example:** An NFT representing a virtual real estate property that also holds a certain amount of in-game currency (ERC-20 tokens).

How RMRK Stands Out
-------------------

**Interoperability:** RMRK is designed to work seamlessly across different blockchain platforms, ensuring broad compatibility and reach. This cross-chain functionality makes RMRK a versatile choice for developers and creators looking to expand their audience and market.

**Flexibility and Customization:** The advanced features of RMRK, such as nested NFTs, multi-asset capabilities, and more, offer creators unparalleled flexibility. Artists, developers, and collectors can customize and interact with their NFTs in ways that were previously impossible.

**User Experience:** RMRK focuses on enhancing the user experience by providing tools and functionalities that make NFTs more engaging and interactive. Whether through dynamic art pieces or complex in-game assets, RMRK aims to push the boundaries of what NFTs can offer.

RMRK has developed dApps for an enhanced user experience:

- **Singular.app:** NFT marketplace
- **Upgradooor.app:** Supercharge ERC721 NFTs into Modular NFTs
- **Mintaur.app:** Create NFTs without upfront costs
- **Emotes.app:** React with on-chain emotes in any NFT
- **Skybreach.app:** Metaverse gaming to showcase everything RMRK tech can do

Token Utilities in the RMRK Ecosystem
-------------------------------------

By leveraging **RMRK tokens**, users can benefit from reduced fees, earn in-game currencies, verify their collections, and access exclusive items. These utilities not only provide economic incentives but also foster a vibrant and interactive community. In this section, we will explore the various ways RMRK tokens can be utilized to maximize their potential within the **RMRK ecosystem**.

1. **Reduced Fees for Minting and Trading Modular NFTs:** Users can enjoy reduced fees (normal fee is 3.5%, discounted fee is 1.95%) on Singular and other RMRK dApps when using $RMRK tokens for minting and trading modular NFTs.
2. **Stake $RMRK to Earn $SILA:** Stake $RMRK tokens to earn $SILA, an in-game currency used for various actions within Skybreach.
3. **Trade NFTs on Secondary Market:** Utilize Singular to trade NFTs on the secondary market seamlessly.
