Launched on August 15, 2022, GM Parachain is dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved with blockchain technology. This article provides an in-depth look at GM Parachain, exploring its features, initiatives, technical achievements, and its role within the Polkadot and Kusama networks.

What is GM Parachain?
---------------------

GM Parachain is a specialized parachain operating on Kusama, Polkadot’s canary network. It aims to serve as a testing ground for innovative blockchain solutions, leveraging Kusama’s experimental environment to deploy and rigorously test new technologies. GM Parachain is not just about serious technological advancements; it also embodies a fun and engaging community ethos, encapsulated in its use of “GM” (Good Morning) and “GN” (Good Night) tokens to foster interaction and engagement among users.

GM Chain Key Features and Innovations
-------------------------------------

#### 1. Light Clients

GM Parachain has been a pioneer, alongside [InvArch’s Tinkernet Network](https://dablock.com/dapps/invarch-network/), in [implementing light clients](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/build-light-clients), which are crucial for enabling efficient blockchain interactions on resource-constrained devices. These clients allow users to interact with the blockchain without needing to download and validate the entire chain.

- **Implementation Success**: GM Parachain, in collaboration with InvArch, was the first to implement light clients on their parachain, marking a significant technical achievement.
- **Community Collaboration**: The team was working with other parachain teams to help them implement light client support, fostering a collaborative and innovative ecosystem.

#### 2. Collator Program

The collator program is essential for maintaining the security and efficiency for any parachain. GM Parachain had tried to onboard new collators and provide support for newcomers to the node-running scene during its first months of life (Narrator: no success).

#### 3. Governance and Community Involvement

Governance is a core component of the Polkadot ecosystem, and GM Parachain is no exception. The team has tried to be integrated with Polkassembly and is enabling the governance pallet via runtime upgrades.

- **Kusama Innovation Cost Reduction Act (KICRA)**: This initiative aims to lower the deposit fees associated with essential extrinsics for parachain teams, making it more cost-effective to launch and maintain parachains on Kusama.

#### 4. Developer and User Tools

GM Parachain is committed to improving the user experience through various tools and integrations.

- **Discord Bot**: A bot that reacts to on-chain transactions, notifying users when they receive GM or GN tokens linked to their Discord ID.
- **RPC Endpoints**: Multiple RPC (Remote Procedure Call) endpoints are available on Polkadot JS, with more being spun up by the community.

GM Technical Achievements
-------------------------

#### 1. Runtime Upgrades

Since its onboarding, GM Parachain has issued its first runtime upgrade, which included the following enhancements:

- **Token Vesting Pallet**: Implemented to manage token distribution and vesting schedules.
- **Address Format Updates**: Ensuring compatibility and standardization across the network.
- **Collator Rewards**: Allocating transaction fees to collators as an incentive mechanism.

#### 2. Light Client Integration

The successful integration of light clients not only enhances user accessibility but also marks a significant technical milestone. This integration was also merged into the Polkadot JS repository, highlighting GM Parachain’s contribution to the broader Polkadot ecosystem.

### Tokenomics and Crowdloan

#### 1. Tokenomics

GM Parachain utilizes $GM and $GN tokens as part of its unique community engagement strategy. These tokens can only be minted during specific times of the day, adding an element of fun and scarcity to their usage.

#### 2. Crowdloan Success

The GM crowdloan was a significant success, with **738 participants** locking their KSM to support the parachain’s launch. These founding members were rewarded with $**FREN** tokens, highlighting GM Parachain’s commitment to community-driven growth and participation.

### Conclusion

**GM Parachain represents a blend of technical innovation, community engagement, and fun within the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems**. By focusing on light clients, robust governance, and user-friendly tools, GM Parachain was setting a high standard for what can be achieved in the blockchain space.
