Mandala Chain is a hybrid layer 1 blockchain designed to address the challenges of data security and privacy in the blockchain space. Built with the Substrate framework, Mandala Chain offers a customizable and modular architecture that prioritizes user confidentiality and anonymity.

## Mandala Chain Key Features:
- **Data Security &amp; Privacy:** Leverages Substrate to create a secure environment for data storage and transfer, with plans to integrate zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for enhanced privacy.
- **Web 2 &amp; Web 3 Integration:** Provides a unique Web2 Layer Integration, seamlessly bridging the gap between traditional applications and the innovative world of Web3.
- **Decentralized Identity:** Empowers users with decentralized identity verification, allowing for secure and private confirmation without compromising personal information.

## The Kepeng Token (KPG):
KPG is the native utility token of Mandala Chain, serving multiple purposes within the ecosystem:

- **Transaction Fees:** Every on-chain transaction requires a KPG payment, with a portion burned and the rest deposited in the treasury.
- **Future On-chain Governance:** KPG will play a central role in future governance proposals and voting processes, empowering token holders to shape the networkâ€™s direction.

## Mandala Technical Architecture:
Mandala Chain leverages the Substrate framework and is written in Rust. Its architecture is built upon core client services and a runtime environment. The core client handles network activity like peer discovery and consensus, while the runtime executes transactions and validates their legitimacy.

## Mandala Chain Interoperability:
Mandala Chain embraces interoperability through bridges and XCM (cross-consensus message) format. Bridges connect Mandala Chain to the Relay Chain, enabling secure communication with other Polkadot parachains. XCM, on the other hand, defines a standard format for messages exchanged between parachains.

## Mandala Chain Smart Contract Functionality:
Mandala Chain offers native support for smart contracts, compatible with both **WebAssembly (ink!)** and **EVM (Solidity)**. This allows developers to leverage familiar tools and languages for building decentralized applications on the Mandala Chain network.

## Mandala Chain Consensus Mechanism:
Mandala Chain is undergoing a phased rollout with a focus on decentralization. It currently operates as a Proof-of-Authority (PoA) chain, with plans to transition to a more decentralized consensus mechanism in the future.

**Overall, Mandala Chain presents a promising solution for secure and private data management in the blockchain ecosystem. Its hybrid architecture, focus on user privacy, and interoperability features position it well to bridge the gap between emerging and global blockchain markets.**
