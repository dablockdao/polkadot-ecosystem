Litentry is a decentralized, cross-chain identity aggregator protocol that empowers users to manage their digital identities across various web3 platforms. It offers a privacy-preserving solution for users to control their personal data and leverage it to gain value in the blockchain ecosystem.

## What is Litentry?

Litentry operates as a decentralized identity aggregator, allowing users to create a comprehensive identity profile by linking their various web3 wallets and web2 accounts. This aggregated identity adheres to W3C DID standards, fostering interoperability across different blockchain networks.

## Litentry’s core functionalities include:

- **Secure Identity Management:** Users can manage their identity data through Litentry’s Identity Hub, enabling them to control what information they share with third-party applications.
- **Privacy-Preserving Computation:** Litentry utilizes Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to perform secure calculations on identity data without revealing the underlying information. This protects user privacy while generating verifiable credentials.
- **Verifiable Credentials:** Litentry issues verifiable credentials based on W3C standards. These credentials act as tamper-proof certifications of a user’s identity attributes, allowing them to share specific data points with dApps without compromising their privacy.

## The LIT Token

The LIT token serves as the utility token within the Litentry ecosystem. Its functions include:

- **Governance:** LIT token holders can participate in the governance of the Litentry protocol, voting on proposals that influence the protocol’s development.
- **Data Access:** Users may need to spend LIT tokens to access certain identity verification services or data analysis features offered by Litentry.
- **Incentivization:** LIT tokens can be used to incentivize users to contribute their identity data to the network and participate in the verification process.

## Benefits of Litentry

Litentry offers several advantages for both users and developers:

- **Users:** Litentry empowers users with control over their identity data and enables them to selectively share information with dApps. This fosters a more privacy-centric experience in the web3 environment.
- **Developers:** Litentry provides developers with a framework for integrating secure and reliable identity verification mechanisms into their dApps. This can enhance user experience and enable the development of innovative applications that leverage identity data.

By providing a decentralized identity aggregation solution, Litentry paves the way for a future where users retain ownership and control of their digital identities within the web3 landscape.
