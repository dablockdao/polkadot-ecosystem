The DeFi platform **Centrifuge amalgamates real-world assets (RWAs) with blockchain technology** to offer a unique approach toward liquidity and financing. Here are the key features and objectives:

- **Tokenization of Real-World Assets**: Centrifuge enables users to tokenize real-world assets such as invoices, real estate, and royalties. These assets are represented as NFTs, making them usable in the DeFi ecosystem.
- **Decentralized Protocol**: It operates on a decentralized network that ensures security, transparency, and innovation. Open protocols are maintained by developers to build financial applications.
- **Integration with DeFi**: Through Tinlake, an application built on Ethereum, Centrifuge integrates RWAs with DeFi platforms. This setup allows for the extraction of liquidity and investment into RWAs.
- **Yield Generation and Financing**: The platform opens new financing avenues for asset holders and provides pooling of tokenized assets and yield opportunities for DeFi investors.
- **CFG Token**: Centrifugeâ€™s native token, CFG, is used for governance, rewarding validators, and incentivizing network participation.

**Centrifuge aims to bridge traditional finance with DeFi**, enabling real economic activity on the blockchain while addressing regulatory compliance and sector adoption. Developed within the Polkadot ecosystem, it enhances its capabilities for interoperability and potential to revolutionize finance.
