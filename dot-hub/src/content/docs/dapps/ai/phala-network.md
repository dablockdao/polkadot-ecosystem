Phala Network is a blockchain protocol that unlocks the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the Web3 space. It acts as the execution layer for **Web3 AI**, enabling developers to build secure and private smart contracts that leverage AI capabilities.

## Why Phala Network?

Traditional blockchain networks struggle to handle complex AI computations due to limitations in privacy and processing power. Phala Network solves this by introducing a hybrid architecture that combines blockchain technology with **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)**.n

### Here’s what Phala offers:

- **Secure and Private AI Execution:** TEE technology ensures the confidentiality of AI computations, protecting sensitive data and algorithms.
- **Smart Contract Integration:** AI functionality becomes seamlessly integrated with smart contracts, enabling new possibilities for decentralized applications.
- **Decentralized Infrastructure:** Phala leverages a network of distributed workers, providing reliable and scalable computing resources for AI tasks.

## Phala Network Key Components:

- **TEE Workers:** These are secure enclaves within CPUs that isolate AI computations, guaranteeing data privacy.
- **Smart Contracts:** Developers can build AI-powered smart contracts using Phala’s framework, enabling logic execution based on AI outputs.
- **Phala Token (PHA):** The native token used for network fees, resource allocation, and staking within the Phala ecosystem.

### Benefits of Building with Phala:

- **Unlocking Web3 for Everyone:** AI-powered agents can simplify complex blockchain interactions, making Web3 more user-friendly.
- **Enhanced Security and Privacy:** Secure enclaves protect sensitive AI models and data, fostering trust within the ecosystem.
- **New Application Possibilities:** The integration of AI with smart contracts opens doors for innovative and intelligent dApps.
