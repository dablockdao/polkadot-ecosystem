NeuroWeb Network represents a transformative step in the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and the decentralized web (Web3). As a decentralized AI blockchain, NeuroWeb is designed to incentivize knowledge creation, connectivity, and sharing through a process called Knowledge Mining. This article provides an in-depth exploration of NeuroWeb, its foundational technologies, core products, and its significant role within the Polkadot ecosystem.

The Genesis of NeuroWeb
-----------------------

NeuroWeb Network evolved from the OriginTrail Parachain through a community governance vote in December 2023. This transition marks a significant milestone in decentralized AI development, leveraging Polkadot’s robust security and interoperability features. NeuroWeb is a permissionless, EVM-enabled blockchain, ensuring seamless integration with existing decentralized applications (dApps) and fostering a vibrant ecosystem of AI-powered solutions.

Neuroweb Core Technologies and Products
---------------------------------------

**1. Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG):** The OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) is the backbone of NeuroWeb. It ensures the provenance, integrity, and verifiability of information utilized by AI systems. By leveraging Knowledge Assets, the DKG provides a reliable and transparent framework for AI models to access and utilize high-quality data.

**2. NEURO Token:** NEURO is the native utility token of the NeuroWeb Network. It fuels the AI knowledge economy by rewarding contributions to the DKG. NEURO incentivizes knowledge creation, sharing, and connectivity, making it a crucial element in the network’s economic model.

**3. zkNFTs:** Zero-Knowledge Non-Fungible Tokens (zkNFTs) are unique digital assets that incorporate privacy features. They allow users to mint, transfer, and manage NFTs without revealing sensitive information. zkNFTs are integral to NeuroWeb’s approach to secure and private digital asset management.

**4. Staking:** Staking mechanisms in NeuroWeb are designed to support network security and provide rewards for participants. Stakers contribute to the network’s decentralization and robustness while earning incentives for their participation.

**5. Knowledge Mining:** Knowledge Mining is the process of producing high-quality, blockchain-tracked knowledge for AI systems. This process involves the discovery, publishing, enrichment, and learning stages, each contributing to the growth and reliability of the DKG.

The NEURO Tokenomics
--------------------

The NEURO token has a total supply cap of 1,000,000,000 tokens, with half initially allocated and the rest minted through perpetual inflation. The distribution is designed to incentivize various network participants, including collators, auction rewards, knowledge miners, and the community treasury.

### **Token Allocation:**

- Collators incentives: 22%
- Auction rewards: 34.5%
- DKG paranets incentivization: 22%
- Treasury: 12.5%
- Community treasury: 6.5%
- Genesis community distribution: 2.5%

Knowledge Mining on NeuroWeb
----------------------------

Knowledge Mining on NeuroWeb follows a cyclical process:

1. **Discovery:** Identifying gaps in the DKG that need new knowledge contributions.
2. **Publishing:** Creating and publishing Knowledge Assets to fill these gaps.
3. **Enrichment:** Enhancing existing knowledge through linking, economic signals, and usage signals.
4. **Learning:** Updating the DKG based on newly acquired knowledge, training AI models, and improving overall data quality.

Knowledge miners are rewarded with NEURO tokens based on the quality and quantity of their contributions, incentivizing continuous growth and improvement of the DKG.

### Conclusion

NeuroWeb is a pioneering force in the decentralized AI landscape, offering a robust platform for knowledge creation and sharing within the Polkadot ecosystem. Its innovative use of blockchain technology ensures the verifiability and integrity of information, fostering a trustworthy and transparent AI future. As NeuroWeb continues to evolve, it promises to play a critical role in advancing the capabilities and ethical foundations of AI.
