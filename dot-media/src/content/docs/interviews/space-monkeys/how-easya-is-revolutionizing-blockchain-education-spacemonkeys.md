The Genesis of EasyA
--------------------

Founded in 2020, EasyA emerged from the Kwok brothers’ shared passion for education and blockchain. Phil, with a scholarly background from Cambridge, and Dom, an alumnus of the University of Pennsylvania and former Blackstone finance professional, combined their diverse expertise to create a platform aimed at solving a critical problem in education. Initially focusing on STEM education, EasyA quickly pivoted to blockchain education as the sector’s potential became evident.

From Bitcoin Mining to Blockchain Education
-------------------------------------------

Both Phil and Dom have been involved in the blockchain space since 2013, starting with Bitcoin mining. Their early exposure to the technology fueled their interest and expertise. The transition from traditional education to blockchain-specific education was driven by the realization that effective learning happens where users spend most of their time—on their mobile devices. EasyA was designed to provide real-time connections between learners and experts, creating an interactive and engaging learning experience.

Hackathons: The Catalyst for Innovation
---------------------------------------

A significant aspect of EasyA’s success is its focus on hackathons. The platform has hosted numerous events, bringing together some of the brightest minds in the blockchain community. The first hackathon, though modest in size, laid the groundwork for the grander events that followed. Today, EasyA’s hackathons attract hundreds of participants, fostering innovation and providing a launchpad for groundbreaking projects.

The brothers emphasized the value of hackathons in giving developers a focused timeframe to turn ideas into reality. These events have produced impressive results, with projects emerging from EasyA’s hackathons securing funding from major venture capital firms like a16z and Founders Fund.

Partnering with Major Blockchain Projects
-----------------------------------------

EasyA’s partnerships with leading blockchain platforms such as Polkadot, Solana, Stellar, and others have been instrumental in its growth. These collaborations enable EasyA to offer diverse and up-to-date challenges, keeping the community engaged and informed about the latest developments in the blockchain space. The platform’s ability to adapt and update content regularly is crucial, given the rapidly evolving nature of blockchain technology.

One of the standout initiatives is the “180 Days of Polkadot,” a series of challenges designed to immerse developers in the Polkadot ecosystem. This initiative, along with upcoming hackathons in London and Harvard, underscores EasyA’s commitment to fostering a vibrant developer community.

Nurturing the Next Generation of Innovators
-------------------------------------------

Phil and Dom’s vision for EasyA goes beyond just education; it’s about nurturing the next generation of blockchain innovators. By providing a platform where developers can learn, experiment, and build, EasyA is helping to cultivate a robust ecosystem of talented individuals ready to push the boundaries of what’s possible with blockchain technology.

EasyA &amp; Blockchain Education Future
---------------------------------------

With over a million developers in their community and 550,000 monthly active users, EasyA shows no signs of slowing down. The Kwok brothers are focused on scaling their platform and continuously improving the learning experience. Future plans include more extensive hackathons, new educational content, and expanding their reach to include even more blockchain ecosystems.
