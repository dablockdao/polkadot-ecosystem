## What is KodaDot?
[**KodaDot**](https://dablock.com/dapps/kodadot/) **is an open-source NFT marketplace within the Polkadot ecosystem**, designed to be multi-chain powered. This means it operates seamlessly across various chains like Polkadot, Kusama, and others running on the EVM.

## Current State of NFTs in Polkadot
The Polkadot ecosystem supports **multiple NFT standards**, including NFT Pallet, Unique Pallet, and ORML NFT. These standards are integrated into various parachains like Basilisk and Astar, providing runtime logic that enhances performance compared to traditional smart contracts. Smart contracts are still used for their ease of extension, but Polkadot’s unique approach offers faster execution and broader capabilities.

## Advantages of Polkadot AssetHub
**AssetHub is a system chain within Polkadot**, using **DOT as its native currency**, which eliminates the need for additional tokens and external liquidity. It is a full-featured NFT pallet offering several off-chain utilities, atomic swaps for trading NFTs, and compatibility with XCM NFTs. The platform supports collection and item metadata, custom attributes, and granular permissions, all natively implemented.

## Special Features of AssetHub
AssetHub boasts unique features such as specific minting settings, off-chain utilities for pre-signing transactions, and seamless migration from Kusama ordinals. One notable capability is atomic swaps, allowing users to trade NFTs directly or with a surcharge, thus facilitating a new market dynamic where NFTs can be swapped or traded with added flexibility.

### AssetHub Overcoming Challenges
Despite its robust features, AssetHub faces challenges like user experience barriers, existential deposits, high fees, and the need for user education. The platform is actively working on reducing fees and improving the onboarding process for new users, including better wallet integration and automated teleportation of assets.

## Polkadot AssetHub Future Prospects and Innovations
KodaDot aims to expand the customization options for NFTs, including editable metadata and enhanced distribution channels. The platform is leveraging new social protocols like Farcaster to introduce interactive features and broaden the reach of AssetHub NFTs.
