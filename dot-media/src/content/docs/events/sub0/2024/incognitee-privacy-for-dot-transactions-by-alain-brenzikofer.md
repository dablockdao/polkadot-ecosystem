At [**Polkadot Decoded 2024**](https://dablock.com/web3-events/polkadot-decoded/), **Alain Brenzikofer** from the [**Integritee Network**](https://dablock.com/dapps/integritee/) delivered an insightful presentation titled “*Incognitee: Privacy for DOT Transactions*“. The talk emphasized the crucial role of privacy in blockchain technology, particularly for [**Polkadot’s ecosystem**](https://dablock.com/ecosystem/), and introduced an innovative solution to enhance privacy while maintaining compliance with regulatory standards.

**The Polarization of Privacy**
-------------------------------

Brenzikofer began by addressing the polarized views on privacy. On one end, there are **those who demand absolute privacy** and view any attempt at compliance as a compromise. **On the other, some fear non-compliance and its potential repercussions**. He highlighted the current state of Polkadot as leaning towards extreme surveillance, offering pseudonymity rather than true privacy. Pseudonymity, he argued, is insufficient as long-term behaviors can still reveal identities.

**Incognitee’s Solution: Layer 2 Privacy for DOT**
--------------------------------------------------

The core of Brenzikofer’s presentation was the **introduction of *Incognitee*, a Layer 2 solution designed to provide true privacy for DOT transactions**. This system allows users to shield a portion of their balance, making transactions private and untraceable on Layer 1. The solution operates on a test net and involves a straightforward process:

1. **Faucet and Balance Setup**: Users start by scanning a QR code, solving a captcha, and receiving 100 PASS tokens on their public balance.
2. **Shielding Balance**: Users can shield part of their balance to the private Layer 2, enabling private transactions.
3. **Private Transactions**: Transactions on Layer 2 are private, with no trace on Layer 1, even to the validators operating Layer 2.
4. **Unshielding Balance**: Users can unshield their balance back to Layer 1, either to the same account or a different one, maintaining privacy through K-anonymity.

### **Compliance and Privacy**

Brenzikofer emphasized that privacy does not equate to aiding criminal activity. Instead, privacy should be the default, with mechanisms in place for law enforcement to access necessary data under specific conditions. He proposed a model where a collective body could authorize selective data disclosure based on evidence of criminal activity, **leveraging trusted execution environments (TEEs)** to enforce these rules.

**Incognitee Applications Beyond Privacy**
------------------------------------------

Beyond private transactions, Incognitee’s technology offers broader applications, including blockchain gaming with low latency and verifiable randomness, decentralized exchanges without front-running risks, and enhanced digital identity protocols. These applications demonstrate the versatility and potential of integrating privacy-enhancing technologies within the blockchain ecosystem.

**Incognitee Future Developments and Mainnet Launch**
-----------------------------------------------------

The presentation concluded with a call for community support to accelerate the development and mainnet launch of Incognitee. Brenzikofer outlined plans to be **live on the Polkadot relay chain by the end of the year or Q1 next year**, contingent on funding and community backing.

### **Conclusion: Balancing Privacy and Compliance**

**Alain Brenzikofer’s presentation at[ Polkadot Decoded 2024](https://dablock.com/web3-events/polkadot-decoded/)** underscored the necessity of privacy in the digital age and presented a viable solution for Polkadot users to achieve it. By balancing privacy with regulatory compliance, Incognitee aims to provide a secure and private transaction environment, fostering greater confidence and adoption within the blockchain community.
