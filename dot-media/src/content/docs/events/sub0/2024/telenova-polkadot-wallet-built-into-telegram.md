Telenova is an innovative Polkadot wallet seamlessly integrated into Telegram, introduced by Leemo from [**Nova Technologies**](https://dablock.com/dapps/nova-wallet/). This tech talk, presented at **Sub0 Asia 2024**, delves into the intricacies of building substrate apps on Telegram, the rationale behind choosing this platform, and the features and benefits of Telenova. Here, we expand on the key points from Leemo’s presentation and incorporate insights from the presentation slides.

Introduction to Substrate Apps on Telegram
------------------------------------------

**Leemo** began by explaining the architecture of Telegram apps, highlighting that they function as web apps within Telegram itself. These apps utilize the standard JavaScript stack for frontend development and any standard backend stack for bot development. **Nova Technologies** leveraged these tools to create **Telenova**, although they encountered some limitations, such as differing behaviors across devices and the need to navigate both Telegram and Substrate SDKs’ restrictions.

### Why Telegram?

Telegram boasts over 800 million monthly active users, with significant overlap between its user base and the Web3 community. The platform’s widespread adoption and existing integration of a wallet make it an ideal environment for deploying Web3 applications. Telegram’s existing ecosystem includes numerous Web3 communities, and its users are already familiar with using apps within the platform. This familiarity reduces the friction typically associated with onboarding new users to Web3 applications.

2. **Nova Wallet**: Offers more features for users wanting to delve deeper into the Polkadot ecosystem.
3. **Nova Spektr**: Provides advanced functionalities like multisig operations and pure proxy support for experienced users.

During the demo, Leemo demonstrated the seamless process of **sending DOT tokens via Telegram**, showcasing the **app’s user-friendly interface** and efficient transaction flow. The demo illustrated how users could easily onboard, create a wallet, and manage their tokens, emphasizing Telenova’s simplicity and effectiveness.

### TeleNova Q&amp;A Session Highlights

- **Account Migration**: Users can migrate their accounts from Telenova to Nova Wallet through the settings menu by revealing their passphrase and importing it into Nova Wallet.
- **User Guidance on Fund Storage**: The app prompts users to migrate to Nova Wallet for enhanced security and features.
- **Technical Implementation**: Instead of using the gift pallet, which is only available on Kusama, Telenova generates a new passphrase, sends funds to it, and provides the passphrase in a link, ensuring compatibility with both Polkadot and Kusama.
