At a recent tech event, **Marta Adamczyk** from **SubQuery** **Network** and **OnFinality** shared groundbreaking developments in Web3 infrastructure. Her talk, titled “Web3 Infra Revolutionised,” focused on SubQuery’s journey, their current achievements, and the exciting future that lies ahead.

SubQuery’s Evolution and Achievements
-------------------------------------

[**SubQuery**](https://dablock.com/dapps/subquery/) started three years ago as an open-source indexer, primarily serving the Polkadot ecosystem. Over time, it expanded its reach to other ecosystems such as Ethereum, Cosmos, Algorand, and Avalanche. Today, **SubQuery supports an impressive 160 networks**, providing essential indexing services that facilitate efficient data retrieval from blockchains.

Subquery Key Innovations and Solutions
--------------------------------------

**1. Enhanced Indexing Services:**

- **Open Source Indexing:** SubQuery provides open-source indexing services, enabling developers to efficiently query blockchain data.
- **GraphQL API:** The platform offers a GraphQL API endpoint, allowing developers to retrieve data in a format suitable for application development.
- **Speed and Flexibility:** SubQuery is noted for its speed, being almost twice as fast as other indexing solutions like The Graph. It supports real-time indexing of unfinalized blocks and offers extensive documentation for developers.

**2. Decentralized Network:**

- **Transition to a Broader Solution:** SubQuery is transitioning from simply providing indexing services to a more holistic infrastructure solution. This includes launching a decentralized network, which acts as a marketplace for indexing and RPC services.
- **Kepler Network Success:** The Kepler Network, a precursor to the mainnet, successfully onboarded over 2,000 indexers, showcasing the scalability and reliability of **SubQuery’s infrastructure**.

**3. Addressing RPC Challenges:**

- **Decentralized RPC Services:** Recognizing the critical role of RPC providers in Web3, SubQuery aims to offer decentralized RPC services. This approach will enhance reliability and reduce costs by distributing the load across multiple nodes.
- **Optimized Nodes:** SubQuery plans to introduce nodes optimized for heavy querying, addressing performance issues associated with traditional RPC nodes.

**4. Multi-Chain Support:**

- **Seamless Data Integration:** SubQuery’s multi-chain indexing support allows developers to retrieve data from various blockchain ecosystems using a single endpoint. This unified approach simplifies the development process for projects deployed across different chains.

SubQuery Roadmap and Future Directions
--------------------------------------

**SubQuery’s roadmap** includes the integration of RPC services into their decentralized network, enhancing the overall infrastructure stack. This initiative aims to democratize access to high-quality RPC services, reducing costs and improving performance for developers. Additionally, the introduction of shared data nodes will further lower operational expenses by distributing blockchain data across multiple nodes.
