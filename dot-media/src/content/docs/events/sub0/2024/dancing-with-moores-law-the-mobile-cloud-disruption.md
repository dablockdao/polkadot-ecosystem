**The Limits of Moore’s Law**
-----------------------------

Moore’s Law is facing significant challenges as the miniaturization of chips approaches atomic levels. This has led to a plateau in performance improvements and energy efficiency. Instead of focusing solely on increasing processing power, the industry is shifting towards enhancing performance per watt. This metric is becoming crucial in an era where energy efficiency and specialized computational loads are paramount.

**The Mobile Cloud Revolution**
-------------------------------

Acurast is at the forefront of leveraging mobile hardware to surpass traditional server hardware in both efficiency and performance. Mobile hardware, with its specialized chips for **machine learning (TPUs)** and **graphics processing (GPUs)**, offers a significant advantage. These chips are not only more energy-efficient but also more cost-effective. For instance, a Google Pixel 7A can outperform traditional server hardware in specific tasks at a fraction of the cost.

**Breaking Monopolies and Enhancing Security**
----------------------------------------------

Currently, a few companies dominate **66% of the global cloud market**, leading to monopolistic pricing and data ownership issues. Acurast aims to disrupt this monopoly by offering a decentralized alternative. By using mobile devices, Acurast provides a more secure and efficient cloud solution. These devices are equipped with strongbox-capable **trusted execution environments (TEEs)** like Google’s Titan M2, ensuring high security and confidentiality.

### **Practical Implications and Use Cases**

[**Acurast**](https://dablock.com/dapps/acurast/)‘s approach has several practical benefits:

- **Cost-Effectiveness:** Mobile devices are significantly cheaper than traditional server hardware.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Operating costs are drastically lower, making it an environmentally friendly option.
- **Upcycling:** Old or partially broken devices can be repurposed, reducing electronic waste.
- **Accessibility:** It opens up opportunities for regions with limited access to traditional cloud services.

#### **Performance Metrics**

Acurast’s performance metrics are impressive. In comparative studies, [**mobile devices running Acurast software**](https://dablock.com/dapps/acurast/) have demonstrated superior execution times compared to major cloud providers, even when accounting for network latency. This makes Acurast a viable option for a wide range of applications, from web crawling to complex computational tasks.
