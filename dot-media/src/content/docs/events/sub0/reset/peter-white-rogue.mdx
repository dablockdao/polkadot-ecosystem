Sub0 Reset 2024 marked an exciting milestone in the Polkadot ecosystem, spotlighting groundbreaking developments in substrate and Web3. The event was a hub for developers, builders, and blockchain enthusiasts eager to deepen their understanding of the Polkadot architecture and explore innovative tools, like the **Pop Network**, enabling seamless interactions across parachains.

From foundational workshops to advanced developer content, the conference aimed to empower participants to build on Polkadot, leveraging its unparalleled multi-chain infrastructure. Notably, the introduction of tools like **Pop Gateway** and innovations in **ismp (Interchain State Message Passing)** exemplified how developers can now fully exploit Polkadot’s ecosystem to create interconnected, decentralized applications.

## Understanding Polkadot: A Digital World of Trustless Verification

Polkadot is often visualized as a digital world where parachains function like cities interconnected by a robust infrastructure—the relay chain. This design offers unprecedented opportunities for developers to build applications based on verification rather than trust, giving users complete control over their data and digital identities.

However, the challenge lies in utilizing this complex infrastructure efficiently. While parachains provide microservices, such as storage or governance tools, developers often struggle to integrate these features into their applications seamlessly. This is where solutions like the **Pop Network** aim to bridge the gap.

## Introducing the Pop Network: The Developer’s Gateway to Polkadot

The **Pop Network**, a parachain within the Polkadot ecosystem, redefines how developers interact with the broader ecosystem. It simplifies the process of building and deploying applications on Polkadot through a **Gateway**, enabling smart contracts to interact with multiple parachains. The Gateway provides key functionalities such as:

1. **Cross-Chain Execution**: Developers can execute tasks on different parachains and receive verified results directly in their smart contracts.
2. **Data Queries**: Applications can query storage from other parachains and incorporate the retrieved data seamlessly.
3. **Composability**: Developers can combine services across Polkadot’s ecosystem to create feature-rich applications.

## Technical Foundations: ismp and Cross-Chain Messaging

### The Role of ismp

The Interchain State Message Passing (ismp) protocol is integral to the Pop Network’s functionality. Built on Polkadot’s shared security model, ismp allows developers to query and verify state data from other parachains. This eliminates the need for trust by relying on Polkadot's relay chain to validate the authenticity of the data.

For example, querying the ownership of an NFT stored on Asset Hub involves the following steps:

1. A storage proof is generated by Asset Hub.
2. The proof is submitted to the relay chain for validation.
3. Once verified, the data is transmitted back to the requesting application on the Pop Network.

### Cross-Chain Messaging (XCM)

To execute actions on other parachains, the Pop Network leverages **Cross-Chain Messaging (XCM)**. Developers can initiate transactions, such as creating assets or interacting with governance systems, without needing to build custom parachains. This composability allows developers to focus on building applications rather than managing infrastructure.

## Practical Demonstration: Building with Pop Network

### Use Case 1: Creating a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)

The demo showcased how a DAO could verify membership eligibility using NFTs stored on a different parachain (Asset Hub). The process involved:

1. Deploying a smart contract on the Pop Network.
2. Querying Asset Hub to verify NFT ownership.
3. Automatically registering eligible users to the DAO.

This functionality exemplifies how Pop Network enables developers to integrate cross-chain capabilities into smart contracts, streamlining application development.

### Use Case 2: Executing Cross-Chain Transactions

In another demo, the Pop Network demonstrated how a smart contract could create an asset on Asset Hub. By encoding transaction data, the smart contract initiated a cross-chain message through XCM, confirmed its execution, and seamlessly integrated the result into the application logic.

## Revolutionizing Developer Experience on Polkadot

The Pop Network's vision aligns with Polkadot’s core philosophy: empowering developers to build applications that leverage the network’s full potential. Key benefits include:

- **Simplified Onboarding**: Tools like the Pop CLI enable developers to set up local environments effortlessly, reducing the learning curve.
- **Enhanced Developer Support**: Workshops and resources at Sub0 Reset 2024 emphasized practical knowledge, helping developers transition from idea to implementation.
- **Future-Ready Infrastructure**: By supporting Ink! smart contracts and offering compatibility with existing parachains, the Pop Network ensures developers can build scalable, future-proof applications.
