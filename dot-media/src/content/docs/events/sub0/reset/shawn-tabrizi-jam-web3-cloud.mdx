## The Vision: From Blockchain Hosting to Web3 Cloud

### Redefining Polkadot’s Role
Tabrizi began by redefining Polkadot’s identity. While traditionally seen as a blockchain network, Polkadot is, at its core, a platform with a broader mission: enabling a world with less trust and more truth. JAM extends this vision by evolving Polkadot from a blockchain-specific infrastructure to a versatile cloud platform for Web3 applications and services.

### The JAM Paradigm
JAM introduces a groundbreaking approach to application development on Polkadot, leveraging a new execution environment called the Polkadot Virtual Machine (PVM). JAM eliminates the need for developers to grapple with blockchain-specific constraints, enabling seamless deployment of Web3 applications with features akin to Web2 cloud environments.

## Understanding JAM: Core Innovations

### The Polkadot Virtual Machine (PVM)
The PVM is the heart of JAM, offering an actor-based execution model optimized for high performance and scalability. Built on RISC-V architecture, the PVM ensures near-native speeds, robust tooling, and compatibility with traditional programming environments. Developers can now run standard applications, even those outside blockchain contexts, on Polkadot's decentralized infrastructure.

**Key features of the PVM:**
- High-speed execution.
- Cost-efficient gas metering.
- Compatibility with legacy architectures like x86.

### Continuations: Overcoming Blockchain Limitations
One of JAM’s standout innovations is its use of *continuations,* a method to save and restore program states across blockchain blocks. This allows complex applications to run uninterrupted, breaking free from the traditional limitations of block size and execution time.

**How it works:**
1. **Save state:** Application data and memory are saved to a data availability layer.
2. **Resume execution:** The program continues seamlessly in the next block.
3. **Completion:** Applications run as though uninterrupted, simplifying developer workflows.

## The Polkadot Cloud: A Web3 Revolution

### Cloud-Like Services for Web3
JAM transforms Polkadot into a fully-fledged Web3 cloud, offering decentralized alternatives to traditional cloud services:
- **Decentralized Execution Service:** Comparable to AWS EC2, providing scalable compute resources.
- **Object Storage:** Decentralized storage akin to Amazon S3.
- **Serverless Smart Contracts:** Functionality similar to AWS Lambda for seamless execution of smart contracts.

### Specifications of the Polkadot Cloud
The JAM-powered Polkadot Cloud boasts an impressive architecture:
- Over **1,000 validators.**
- **341 cores** for decentralized execution.
- **2 petabytes** of data availability.
- More than **1 million transactions per second (TPS).**

These specifications position Polkadot as the premier platform for scalable, resilient Web3 applications.

## Why Choose JAM for Web3 Development?

### Advantages Over Traditional Blockchain Development
Historically, blockchain-based application development has been a specialized, cumbersome process. JAM eliminates these barriers by abstracting blockchain complexities, allowing developers to focus on creating applications, not wrestling with infrastructure.

**Old Paradigm:**
- Specialized blockchain programming.
- Applications constrained by block size and gas limits.

**JAM Paradigm:**
- Build applications like in Web2.
- JAM handles execution continuity and scalability.

### JAM vs. Web2 Cloud Services
While JAM's decentralized nature may introduce slightly higher costs compared to Web2 clouds, it offers unparalleled benefits:
- **Resilience:** Applications are censorship-resistant and globally accessible.
- **Direct Access to Ecosystem:** Developers retain control over transactions and user interactions, bypassing centralized intermediaries.

## A Modular Future: Decoupled Services
JAM supports a modular architecture, allowing developers to use individual services as needed. For example:
- A project can leverage only the **data availability layer** for specific applications.
- Another might deploy complete **blockchain hosting services.**

This flexibility mirrors Web2 cloud service models, providing developers with tailored solutions without compromising the cohesive Polkadot experience.

## Real-World Applications and Use Cases

### Gaming and Beyond
One of the most striking demonstrations of JAM’s capabilities is its ability to run standard applications, such as the classic game *Doom.* This example underscores JAM’s potential to host a wide range of Web3 applications, from gaming to enterprise-grade solutions.

### Stateless Applications
JAM supports stateless applications that rely solely on data availability layers, enabling lightweight, ephemeral services that reduce blockchain footprint.

## Challenges and the Path Ahead

### Addressing Supply-Demand Imbalance
Tabrizi acknowledged that JAM’s infrastructure is far ahead of current demand in the Web3 space. However, this overcapacity positions Polkadot to support exponential growth as the ecosystem matures.

### Educating Developers
Transitioning to JAM requires a mindset shift for developers accustomed to traditional blockchain or Web2 paradigms. The Polkadot ecosystem must invest in education and tooling to drive adoption.
