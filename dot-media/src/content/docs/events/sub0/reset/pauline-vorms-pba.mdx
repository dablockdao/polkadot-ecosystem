The **Sub0 Reset 2024** event highlighted a pivotal moment in blockchain education, focusing on the efforts of the **Polkadot Blockchain Academy (PBA)** to scale learning opportunities in the Web3 space. Founded in 2022, the PBA offers cutting-edge educational programs designed to equip developers and innovators with the knowledge necessary to thrive in the Polkadot ecosystem. Now, the PBA is expanding its reach with a program that will educate thousands of students, aligning with **Gavin Wood's** vision of expanding the pool of talented blockchain professionals.

## The Mission of the Polkadot Blockchain Academy

The PBA was established with a clear mission: **to educate for a more truthful world**. By running comprehensive educational programs, the academy equips developers and innovators with the necessary knowledge and skills to thrive in Web3, with a particular emphasis on the **Polkadot ecosystem**. Over the past two years, the PBA has trained over **400 developers and builders**, making it the **largest producer of tech talent** for the Polkadot community.

## Doing the Unscalable to Achieve Excellence

Before considering scalability, the PBA focused on creating an unparalleled learning experience by doing things that traditionally do not scale:

- **Rigorous Admission Process**: The academy implemented a stringent selection process involving coding assessments and interviews to identify top talent.
- **In-Person Education**: Contrary to the trend of online learning, the PBA invested in intensive, on-site programs. Developers gathered in key markets like the UK, Buenos Aires, Hong Kong, and Singapore for immersive five-week courses.
- **Expert Faculty**: Instead of relying on professional educators, the academy brought in the **actual builders and engineers of Polkadot**. This approach ensured that students received up-to-date, high-quality content directly from industry leaders.
- **Community Integration**: From the outset, the PBA fostered strong connections with the Polkadot community. Students interacted with existing projects and contributors, allowing them to apply their learning in real-world contexts.

## The Case for In-Person Education

The academy's commitment to **in-person education** created a unique environment where students could:

- **Engage Deeply with Content**: Intensive programs covered the equivalent of one to two semesters of a master’s degree within five weeks.
- **Collaborate and Innovate**: The close-knit setting facilitated late-night discussions and weekend collaborations, leading to the inception of new projects within the Polkadot ecosystem.
- **Receive Personalized Feedback**: In-person code reviews and extended discussions allowed for a deeper understanding of complex topics.

---

## Faculty Comprised of Industry Builders

By involving the very individuals who are building Polkadot, the PBA ensured that:

- **Content Remained Cutting-Edge**: Students learned about the latest developments directly from those implementing them.
- **Real-World Insights Were Shared**: Faculty members provided practical perspectives, bridging the gap between theory and application.
- **Collaborative Opportunities Emerged**: Direct interactions often led to students contributing to existing projects or launching their own within the ecosystem.

---

## Integrating with the Polkadot Ecosystem

The academy didn’t operate in isolation. By actively involving the Polkadot community:

- **Students Gained Practical Exposure**: Guest lectures and presentations from existing projects helped students understand the practical applications of their learning.
- **Alumni Contributed Back**: Graduates have gone on to join or even found projects within the ecosystem, showcasing the program’s effectiveness.

## Expanding Reach: Educating Thousands

Recognizing the need to reach a broader audience, the PBA is expanding its reach with a program that will educate thousands of students. This initiative aims to:

- **Scale Education Efforts**: Transitioning from training hundreds to potentially thousands of learners annually.
- **Maintain Quality in a Flexible Format**: While scaling up, the program retains the academy's high standards, offering a strong introduction to blockchain fundamentals and Polkadot-specific knowledge.
- **Expand Accessibility**: By lowering barriers to entry, the PBA makes blockchain education more accessible globally.

## The Future of Blockchain Education

The expansion signifies a significant step toward scaling blockchain education without compromising quality. By deconstructing their successful on-campus experience and adapting it for a broader audience, the PBA aims to:

- **Reach a Global Audience**: Learners from any location can now access top-tier blockchain education.
- **Cater to Diverse Schedules**: Flexible program formats allow professionals with existing commitments to participate.
- **Introduce Blockchain Enthusiasts to Web3**: Beyond developers, the program serves as an entry point for anyone interested in the blockchain space.

## Upcoming In-Person Programs

While expanding its reach, the PBA remains committed to its **in-person programs**. Plans are underway to return to Europe for the next on-site cohort, continuing the tradition of immersive, high-impact education.

## Conclusion

The **Polkadot Blockchain Academy's** efforts exemplify how blockchain education can be both **deep and scalable**. Under the leadership of Pauline Cohen Vorms, their commitment to quality, community integration, and innovative teaching methods sets a benchmark for educational programs in the rapidly evolving blockchain landscape. By leveraging a blend of in-person excellence and expanded accessibility, the PBA is poised to shape the next generation of **Web3 developers and enthusiasts**.
