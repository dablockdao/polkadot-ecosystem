At the **Sub0 Reset 2024** event in Bangkok, **Sergei Lonshakov**, a seasoned software architect at Robonomics, unveiled the company's first hardware lineup of four smart devices. Built on the Polkadot infrastructure and powered by the **Robonomics Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN)** full stack, these devices aim to revolutionize the Internet of Things (IoT) landscape for cyberpunks and privacy-conscious users alike.

## Hardware for Cyberpunks 2025: Introducing Robonomics' DePIN-Powered Smart Devices

Lonshakov, with over a decade of experience in blockchain technology and robotics, delved into the intricacies of creating hardware solutions that are innovative and aligned with the principles of decentralization and user privacy.

### The Three Pillars of DePIN Projects

Lonshakov emphasized that any successful DePIN project must comprise three significant components:

#### 1. Hardware Side
Developing the hardware requires expertise beyond traditional software development. It involves:

- **Programming Languages:** Proficiency in C and C++ for embedded systems.
- **Embedded Systems:** Knowledge of microcontrollers and low-energy sensors.
- **Industry Standards:** Adherence to IoT protocols like Bluetooth Low Energy and Zigbee.

Robonomics boasts a team with five master's degrees in robotics and engineers with over five years of experience, underscoring the importance of specialized skills in hardware development.

#### 2. Connectivity Layer
The connectivity layer is crucial for true decentralization:

- **Peer-to-Peer Technologies:** Avoiding client-server models in favor of decentralized networks.
- **Real-Time Data Transfer:** Establishing two data flowsâ€”real-time data transmission and historical data storage.
- **Open Connectivity Network:** Utilizing Robonomics' network to ensure seamless communication between devices and applications.

#### 3. Web3 Cloud Functions
To eliminate reliance on corporate clouds:

- **Decentralized Storage:** Storing the digital footprint of devices on Web3 infrastructure.
- **Privacy Preservation:** Ensuring user data remains confidential and under user control.

### Case Study: The Civil Sensor Network

An exemplar of Robonomics' DePIN approach is the **Civil Sensor Network**, which has survived and evolved over the past three years.

- **Open-Source Hardware:** The design and software are available on GitHub for community use and modification.
- **Global Reach:** Approximately 100 sensors across 56 cities collect data on pollution, noise, temperature, humidity, and radiation.
- **Real-Time Data Access:** Users can access live data via web browser applications without corporate intermediaries.
- **Web3 Integration:** Historical data is stored and accessed through decentralized networks like IPFS, ensuring data integrity and availability.

### Privacy and Decentralization: Core Principles

Lonshakov stressed the importance of privacy and decentralization in IoT devices:

- **Data Ownership:** Users retain control over their data, with encryption ensuring privacy.
- **Decentralized Interactions:** Devices communicate via peer-to-peer networks, reducing the risk of data breaches.
- **Polkadot Integration:** Leveraging Polkadot's blockchain technology to enhance security and interoperability.

#### Addressing Privacy Concerns

- **Minimal Data Footprint:** Devices send only necessary data, often in anonymized or aggregated forms.
- **Avoiding Corporate Clouds:** By not relying on centralized servers, users mitigate exposure to third-party surveillance.
- **User Configurability:** Users can adjust privacy settings to their comfort level.
