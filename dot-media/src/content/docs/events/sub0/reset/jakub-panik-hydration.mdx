At the **Sub0 Reset 2024** event, **Jakub Panik**, the CTO of Intergalactic and Hydration, presented an in-depth session on leveraging the Polkadot SDK and Substrate to build intent-based state machines. His talk focused on modifying the Polkadot SDK chain for specific use cases, optimizing parachain runtime efficiency, and integrating cross-chain capabilities. This article delves into the key aspects of his presentation, exploring how intent-based systems can revolutionize transaction execution and throughput in decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems.

## Hydration: A DeFi Hub Built on Polkadot

Hydration is a DeFi hub that hosts the **Omnipool** and other automated market makers (AMMs). It allows users to:

- **Pay transaction fees** in any asset.  
- Utilize **swap-related automation** like dollar-cost averaging (DCA).  
- Access **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility**.  
- Engage with upcoming features like a **money market** (pending audits).  

Despite being a standard Polkadot SDK chain, Hydration incorporates numerous plugins that enhance its functionality.

## Defining the Problem Space

Jakub outlined several requirements to improve Hydration's performance:

1. **Enhance Price Execution**: Implement limit orders and swap triggers.  
2. **Boost Transaction Throughput**: Increase the number of transactions processed per second.  
3. **Integrate Cross-Chain Capabilities**: Enable seamless interoperability with other chains.  
4. **Maintain System Integrity**: Keep existing features operational and minimize breaking changes for developers.

## Exploring Past Solutions

### On-Chain Order Matching Engine

In August 2020, Jakub's team developed an **on-chain order matching engine** during a hackathon. This engine allowed users to match opposing transactions within a single block, executing transfers or swaps without slippage. However, its slower processing compared to standard transactions led to its discontinuation.

### Off-Chain Transaction Matching

Protocols like **CoW Swap** and **Uniswap X** introduced **off-chain transaction matching**, where matches are made off-chain, and solutions are posted on-chain for settlement. This approach inspired the development of an **intent and solver-based system**.

## The Intent and Solver-Based System

### Understanding Intents

An **intent** is a user-defined action specifying what they want to achieve without detailing how to execute it. Key features include:

- **Swap Intents**: Currently focused on swaps but can extend to borrowing, adding, or removing liquidity.  
- **Triggers**: Actions executed upon success, failure, or partial execution of an intent.  

### Role of Solvers

**Solvers** observe the blockchain, collect intents from the previous block, and compose optimal solutions. They:

- Group compatible intents into **solving groups**.  
- Construct instructions for executing swaps efficiently.  
- Submit solutions to the blockchain for validation and execution.  

---

## System Workflow

1. **Intent Collection**: Users submit intents via **Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs)**.  
2. **Block Inclusion**: Block builders include these intents in the blockchain.  
3. **Solution Composition**: Solvers extract intents, create solutions, and submit them to the next block.  
4. **Validation and Execution**: The blockchain validates solutions, and matched intents are settled through direct transfers, while unmatched ones fall back to existing pools like the Omnipool.

## Technical Implementation

### Calculating Transaction Size

The system calculates transaction weights based on the number of intents and the complexity of operations (transfers vs. swaps). This optimization results in:

- **Cheaper execution** compared to traditional AMMs.  
- **Scalability benefits** as more intents are matched together.  

### Validating Solutions

Solutions are validated through a scoring system that considers:

- **Excess Aggregate Demand or Supply**: Measures leftover assets after matching.  
- **Optimality**: Based on algorithms from research papers like *Optimal Routing for Constant Function Market Makers* and *Outer Approximation*.  

Only the **best solution per block** is accepted, and solvers can be penalized (**slashed**) for submitting invalid solutions.

### Custom Block Ordering

To accommodate the new system, the traditional block execution order is modified:

1. **Priority Execution**: Solution execution and money market liquidations occur first.  
2. **Custom Transaction Priorities**: Transactions are ordered based on type rather than user nonce or weight.  
3. **Non-Consecutive Nonces**: Allows flexibility in transaction ordering within a block.

## Cross-Chain Capabilities with ERC 7683

The adoption of **ERC 7683**, a cross-chain intent standard, enables:

- **Interoperability**: Compatibility with over 30 protocols and chains.  
- **Solver Networks**: Access to existing solver infrastructures for efficient intent resolution.  
- **Near-Instant Execution**: Rapid cross-chain transactions for users.

### How It Works

1. **Intent Submission**: Users post intents on the source chain with escrow contracts.  
2. **Solver Execution**: Solvers settle intents on the destination chain.  
3. **Proof and Reimbursement**: Solvers provide proof of settlement to receive compensation, often facilitated by bridges.

## Benefits and Outcomes

Implementing this intent-based system yields significant advantages:

- **Increased Throughput**: Achieves a minimum 5x increase, supporting over 200 swaps per second.  
- **Scalability**: Can efficiently handle 10,000+ intents simultaneously.  
- **Improved Price Execution**: Offers swaps without slippage and enhanced market protection.  
- **Cross-Chain Integration**: Provides almost instant execution across different blockchain networks.  
- **Automation Enhancements**: Utilizes triggers for advanced automation capabilities in DeFi operations.

## Conclusion

Jakub Panik's presentation at Sub0 Reset 2024 showcased a transformative approach to building intent-based state machines using **Substrate** and the **Polkadot SDK**. By reimagining transaction execution through **intents** and **solvers**, Hydration significantly improves performance, scalability, and user experience in the DeFi space. The integration of cross-chain standards like **ERC 7683** positions Hydration at the forefront of blockchain innovation, paving the way for more efficient and interconnected ecosystems.
