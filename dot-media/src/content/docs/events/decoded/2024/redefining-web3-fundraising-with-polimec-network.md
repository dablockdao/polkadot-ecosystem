At Polkadot Decoded 2024, Luca von Wyttenbach, a key figure at [**Polimec**](https://dablock.com/dapps/polimec/), delivered an insightful presentation on redefining Web3 fundraising. He outlined Polimec’s innovative approach to addressing the challenges faced by projects in the blockchain ecosystem when raising funds.

**The Journey of Polimec Protocol**
-----------------------------------

Luca began by reflecting on Polimec’s progress over the past three years. The team started by exploring the ecosystem, understanding market demands, and connecting with other projects. Last year, they showcased a demo of their product, and this year, they proudly presented their live product and its capabilities within the ecosystem.

**Polimec’s Core Functionality**
--------------------------------

Polimec aims to streamline the fundraising process for Web3 projects, focusing on three main stakeholders: participants (investors), projects (fundraisers), and the protocol that connects them. The platform provides a solution that aggregates these stakeholders, ensuring that participants can find the best projects to invest in, and projects can raise funds efficiently from committed investors who provide additional value beyond capital.

**Polimec Protocol Key Milestones Achieved**
--------------------------------------------

Since the last Polkadot Decoded, Polimec has achieved significant milestones:

1. **Parachain Slot**: Polimec secured the 51st parachain slot, enabling them to build their product on solid technological infrastructure and cover transactional fees for participants.
2. **Token Generation Event (TGE)**: The TGE allowed Polimec to launch their functionalities in a tokenized environment, facilitating value transfer through monetary incentives.
3. **Identity Solutions**: Collaborating with the KILT Protocol, Polimec developed decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to ensure one person equals one user on the internet, eliminating Sybil attacks while maintaining user privacy.

**Polimec Innovative Features**
-------------------------------

Polimec introduced several innovative features:

- **Dispenser Function**: This feature ensures targeted airdrops by allowing one claim per DID, preventing multiple claims by the same user and enhancing capital efficiency.
- **Private Sales and Data Rooms**: Polimec enables verified access to private sales, where only KYC-completed participants can access sensitive project information, similar to traditional financial practices.
- **Written Due Diligences**: This feature allows investors to get second opinions from experts before investing, thereby enhancing the investment decision-making process.

**Polimec Future Directions**
-----------------------------

Luca outlined Polimec’s future focus areas:

1. **User Experience**: Polimec aims to simplify the user experience by allowing end-users to use stablecoins like USDT and USDC without needing to buy Polimec’s native tokens. This will be achieved through a protocol utility borrowing model.
2. **EVM Integration**: By integrating with EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), Polimec will expand its reach to more users and projects, facilitating participation in fundraises on EVM-based chains.
3. **White Label Solution**: Polimec’s ultimate goal is to offer a white label solution, enabling exchanges and other financial intermediaries to integrate early-stage Web3 deals seamlessly, providing additional business streams without the end-users needing to interact directly with the Polimec protocol.

**Polimec Impact and Vision**

[**Polimec’s protocol**](https://dablock.com/dapps/polimec/) is designed to lower entry barriers, ensuring broad access to fundraising opportunities. By providing a decentralized, permissionless chain with permissioned ecosystems, Polimec aims to offer projects and investors a secure, efficient, and user-friendly fundraising platform.

Luca concluded by emphasizing the importance of continuous innovation and collaboration within the ecosystem. With Polimec’s robust infrastructure and forward-looking approach, they are well-positioned to shape the future of Web3 fundraising, opening doors to new opportunities and driving the growth of the blockchain ecosystem.

Polimec’s presentation at [**Polkadot Decoded 2024** ](https://dablock.com/web3-events/polkadot-decoded/)highlighted their commitment to enhancing the fundraising landscape in Web3, offering a comprehensive solution that benefits both projects and investors. As they continue to evolve, Polimec is set to play a crucial role in the future of blockchain fundraising.
