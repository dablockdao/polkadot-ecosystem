At the Polkadot Decoded 2024 event, Gabriel Facco de Arruda, founder and CTO of [**InvArch Network**](https://dablock.com/dapps/invarch-network/), presented a transformative solution aimed at addressing a critical challenge in the blockchain ecosystem: account fragmentation. This challenge arises as the future of Web3 envisions a seamless integration of thousands of chains and decentralized applications (dApps) into one global system of networks.

**Blockchain Account Fragmentation and the Need for a Unified Solution**
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In his presentation, Gabriel highlighted the fragmentation problem wherein every additional bridged network introduces another account for users to manage. This leads to a complex user experience where a single user might need multiple wallets and accounts to navigate the Web3 landscape. Such fragmentation is not only inconvenient but also limits the scalability and usability of blockchain technology across different platforms.

**Introducing InvArch MPC**
---------------------------

**The InvArch MPC (Multi-Party Computation)** aims to resolve this issue by offering a user-centric approach to interoperability. It features programmable accounts that can access any blockchain, functioning as an omnichain access layer for Web3. This new paradigm allows a single account to transact on multiple blockchains, simplifying the user experience and enhancing the potential for cross-chain interactions.

**How InvArch MPC Works**

The core innovation of the InvArch MPC is its **decentralized threshold signature protocol**. This protocol enables the creation of programmable accounts that can transact on any blockchain without the need for multiple separate accounts. Gabriel demonstrated the functionality of this system with a live demo, showcasing transactions on Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Polkadot using a single account connected to the InvArch MPC network.

During the demo, he showed how transactions are signed and executed through the network’s nodes, emphasizing the security and decentralization of the system. The transactions spanned multiple blockchains, demonstrating the seamless interoperability offered by InvArch MPC.

**Developer Integration and Future Prospects**

Gabriel also elaborated on the extensibility of the InvArch MPC through its SDK (Software Development Kit). This SDK allows developers to integrate omnichain access into their dApps, wallets, and other blockchain-based applications. The InvArch MPC supports various blockchain networks, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polkadot, and plans to extend support to others such as Solana.

**InvArch MPCPotential Impact**
-------------------------------

The InvArch MPC promises to revolutionize the way users and applications interact with multiple blockchains. By providing a single, programmable account that can operate across different networks, it simplifies user interactions and paves the way for more integrated and scalable blockchain solutions. This innovation is poised to enhance the usability of Web3, making it more accessible and efficient for users and developers alike.

Gabriel’s presentation at Polkadot Decoded 2024 highlighted the significant strides InvArch is making towards solving some of the most pressing issues in blockchain technology. With the upcoming beta release and plans for further development, InvArch MPC is set to become a cornerstone of the future blockchain ecosystem, enabling a truly omnichain future.
