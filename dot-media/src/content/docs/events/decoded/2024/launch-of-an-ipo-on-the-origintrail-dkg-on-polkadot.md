Branimir Rakic of [**OriginTrail**](https://dablock.com/dapps/neuroweb/) took the stage at Polkadot Decoded 2024 to present the groundbreaking concept of launching an Initial Paranet Offering (IPO) on the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG). This innovative initiative aims to leverage the decentralized and open-source nature of the Polkadot ecosystem to build a truly open AI.

Understanding the Concept: Decentralized Knowledge Graph
--------------------------------------------------------

Rakic opened his presentation by discussing the emergence of a new global collective intelligence driven by AI. He highlighted the challenges associated with current AI models, such as data ownership, centralization, hallucinations, bias, and model collapse. These issues underscore the importance of building a decentralized knowledge base that is verifiable, crowdsourced, and owned by all of humanity.

The OriginTrail DKG, built on Polkadot, aims to solve these problems by providing a decentralized infrastructure for knowledge sharing and verification. This system ensures that knowledge assets are stored securely, transparently, and with clear provenance, addressing the issues of data integrity and ownership.

Initial Paranet Offering: A New Frontier
----------------------------------------

Rakic introduced the concept of an Initial Paranet Offering (IPO), a novel method for crowdsourcing knowledge into the decentralized graph. This process involves participants mining knowledge assets, which are then rewarded with Neuro tokens, the native currency of the OriginTrail ecosystem. The IPO is designed to incentivize the community to contribute valuable knowledge, thereby expanding the decentralized knowledge graph.

During his talk, Rakic demonstrated the process of mining knowledge assets using the Paranet system. He showcased how users can submit documents, which are then parsed and added to the knowledge graph. This process is facilitated by the integration of decentralized retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems, ensuring that the data is both relevant and accurate.

OriginTrailPractical Applications and Future Developments
---------------------------------------------------------

One of the key highlights of the presentation was the introduction of the “Polkabot” AI system. This system uses the decentralized knowledge graph to provide accurate and verifiable answers to user queries, minimizing the risk of AI hallucinations. Rakic demonstrated the functionality of Pabot, showing how it retrieves and verifies information from the DKG before generating responses.

The presentation also touched on the economic aspects of the system. Rakic explained that the cost of minting knowledge on the network is relatively low, making it accessible for a wide range of users. Additionally, the system allows for the monetization of private knowledge, creating a knowledge marketplace where users can trade valuable information for tokens.

Origintrail Looking Ahead
-------------------------

Rakic concluded his presentation by inviting the community to participate in the IPO and contribute to the growth of the decentralized knowledge graph. He emphasized the potential of this technology to revolutionize the way AI systems are trained and knowledge is shared, paving the way for a more open and equitable AI ecosystem.

The launch of the IPO on the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph represents a significant step forward in the development of decentralized AI. By harnessing the power of the Polkadot ecosystem, OriginTrail is set to create a more transparent, secure, and collaborative future for AI and knowledge sharing.
