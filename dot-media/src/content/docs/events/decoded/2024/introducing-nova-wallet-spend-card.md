**Key Highlights from the** **Nova Wallet** **Presentation at Decoded 2024**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **1. Simplified Onboarding with Web2-Like Experience**

Anton began by stressing the importance of seamless onboarding for users new to the Web3 ecosystem. Nova Wallet addresses the mental barrier associated with private keys and seed phrases by offering a web2-like onboarding experience. Users can now onboard using their Apple or Google accounts, ensuring a secure and straightforward entry into the Polkadot ecosystem.

### **2. Nova Wallet Advanced Staking Features**

Leemo took the stage to explain the comprehensive staking features of Nova Wallet. Staking is the main product in the Polkadot ecosystem, with over 58.5% of all DOT staked. Nova Wallet caters to both newcomers and pros with features like one-click staking, staking management, and hardware wallet support. The wallet also offers zero fees, staking hints, and the ability to stake with as little as one DOT, making it accessible to a wide range of users.

### **3. Nova Wallet Impressive Staking Growth**

Since its inception, Nova Wallet has shown significant growth in staking. With over 11 million DOT staked and a total value of over 300 million dollars, it is now the leading wallet in the Polkadot ecosystem. The wallet boasts over 15,000 users, representing 25% of all stakers in the ecosystem.

### **4. Introducing the Nova Wallet Spend Card**

The most exciting announcement was the introduction of the Nova Wallet Spend Card, a debit card powered by Mercurio and integrated with the Polkadot network. This card allows users to spend their crypto assets anywhere MasterCard is accepted, starting with Europe and the UK, and expanding to LATAM and the US in the following year. This innovation bridges the gap between digital assets and real-world spending, making it easier for users to utilize their crypto holdings.

**Nova Wallet Future Roadmap**
------------------------------

Nova Wallet is not stopping here. The team is working on a self-custodial card solution that will enable users to receive staking rewards directly to their card balance, making the process seamless and intuitive. This solution aims to elevate the utility of Polkadot tokens and drive more transactions within the ecosystem.
