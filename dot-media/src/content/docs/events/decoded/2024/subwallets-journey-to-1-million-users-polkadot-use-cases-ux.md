In blockchain, achieving significant milestones requires not just innovative solutions but also a keen understanding of **user experience (UX)**. At the recent [**Polkadot Decoded 2024 event**](https://dablock.com/web3-events/polkadot-decoded/), Subwallet demonstrated how it has successfully navigated these waters, setting a new standard for wallet interfaces in the Polkadot ecosystem. Presented by Kate Hà and DJ Há Trang, the talk titled “*Road to 1 Million Users: How [**Subwallet**](https://dablock.com/dapps/subwallet/) Aggregates Polkadot Use Cases with Easy UX”* highlighted Subwallet’s strategic approach to solving critical challenges and its pathway to becoming the most used wallet in the Polkadot ecosystem.

The Challenges of a Multi-Chain Ecosystem
-----------------------------------------

Polkadot’s multi-chain nature offers unparalleled scalability and development flexibility but comes with the inherent challenge of fragmentation. Users often struggle with asset management across various chains, such as Polkadot, Kusama, and Moonbeam, leading to a convoluted user experience. Subwallet tackles this issue by aggregating multi-chain assets into a single, intuitive interface, allowing users to manage their holdings seamlessly.
