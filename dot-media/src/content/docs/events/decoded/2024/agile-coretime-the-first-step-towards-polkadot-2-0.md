Polkadot Decoded 2024, held at the Impact Stage, brought forth significant insights into the future of the [Polkadot ecosystem](https://dablock.com/ecosystem/) with a detailed presentation by **Maciej Zyszkiewicz** from[ Parity Technologies](https://dablock.com/ecosystem/parity-technologies/). The session titled “*Coretime – The First Step Towards Polkadot 2.0*” shed light on the advancements and strategic direction that Polkadot is poised to take, especially with the introduction of agile coretime.

Introduction to Polkadot Coretime
---------------------------------

Maciej Zyszkiewicz’s presentation commenced with a comprehensive **overview of Coretime**, emphasizing its role as **a critical step towards Polkadot 2.0**. Coretime represents Polkadot’s innovative method of allocating block space, which is fundamental to the network’s operation. It’s a shift from the traditional model, focusing on flexibility and efficiency in resource allocation.

Polkadot’s Evolution: From 1.0 to 2.0
-------------------------------------

The Polkadot ecosystem, initially envisioned in the **Polkadot 1.0 whitepaper**, has evolved significantly. **Polkadot 2.0**, as highlighted by Zyszkiewicz, **introduces asynchronous backing and agile coretime**, aiming to address the limitations identified in the original design. These enhancements are crucial for accommodating the diverse and growing needs of the Polkadot community.

Key Features of Agile Coretime
------------------------------

**[Agile coretime](https://dablock.com/guides/what-is-polkadot-agile-coretime/) is not a monolithic feature but a suite of functionalities designed to enhance flexibility and efficiency**. These features are categorized into methods of acquiring and manipulating coretime. Here are the primary aspects:

1. **Bulk Coretime Auctions**: 
  - Replaces the old slot auction model with 28-day periods.
  - Offers optional renewability, simplifying the payment method where tokens are burned instead of being locked.
  - Introduces a transferable, programmable structure, akin to NFTs, allowing easier management and trading of coretime.
2. **Interlacing**: 
  - Allows multiple parachains to share a single core, reducing costs and increasing flexibility.
  - Supports scheduling multiple tasks on a single core, catering to varied block space needs.
3. **On-Demand Coretime**: 
  - Provides low-latency block space acquisition, ideal for temporary or experimental parachains.
  - Ensures quick access to block space with pre-registered WASM, catering to unpredictable demand.
4. **Elastic Scaling**: 
  - Addresses high throughput needs by allowing parachains to utilize multiple cores dynamically.
  - Enhances block production rates and reduces average block time, crucial for applications requiring rapid transactions.

Agile Coretime Benefits and Market Mechanisms
---------------------------------------------

The new system introduces secondary markets as a core component, not an afterthought. These markets allow trading and manipulating coretime, giving the community the flexibility to **create derivatives, order books, and automated renewals**. Platforms like [**Elastic oretime marketplace**](https://dablock.com/dapps/lastic/) and [**Region X**](https://dablock.com/dapps/regionx/) are pivotal in enabling these functionalities, providing interfaces to interact with the agile coretime system seamlessly.

Polkadot Agile Coretime Roadmap and Future Developments
-------------------------------------------------------

Zyszkiewicz outlined the **roadmap for deploying agile coretime features**. Many functionalities are already live on Kusama, with full deployment on Polkadot expected soon. Key features like on-demand coretime and elastic scaling are undergoing testing and are anticipated to be available in the upcoming months.

### Conclusion

The transition to agile coretime marks a significant milestone for Polkadot, aiming to enhance resource allocation flexibility, reduce entry barriers, and maintain price stability. As Polkadot moves towards 2.0, these innovations are set to provide a robust foundation for a more adaptable and efficient blockchain ecosystem, supporting a diverse range of applications and user needs.

Maciej Zyszkiewicz’s detailed presentation at [**Polkadot Decoded 2024**](https://dablock.com/web3-events/polkadot-decoded/) has set the stage for these advancements, highlighting the community’s collaborative efforts towards achieving the goals of Polkadot 2.0.
