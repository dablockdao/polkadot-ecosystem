In the blockchain industry, scalability remains a critical challenge. At [Polkadot Decoded 2024](https://dablock.com/web3-events/polkadot-decoded/), Maarten Henskens, Head of the Astar Foundation, delivered an insightful talk on “Scaling Further with Layer 2 Tech Stack: Our Learnings.” This article delves into the key points of his presentation, highlighting the advancements and challenges encountered by Astar Network in their pursuit of enhanced scalability.

**Astar Network: A Brief Overview**
-----------------------------------

[**Astar Network**](https://dablock.com/dapps/astar-network/), originally launched as Plasm in 2019, has evolved into a robust blockchain protocol founded in Japan. It focuses on driving blockchain adoption in Asia through partnerships with major Japanese corporations such as Sony and NTT Docomo. Astar Network’s unique approach involves integrating multiple virtual machines, including Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and WebAssembly (Wasm), providing developers with versatile environments to deploy smart contracts.

**The Journey to Layer 2 Solutions**
------------------------------------

The presentation outlined Astar Network’s strategic pivot to Layer 2 solutions, motivated by the need for greater scalability, reduced transaction costs, and enhanced speed. Layer 2 technologies, particularly those involving zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-rollups), have gained traction for their potential to alleviate congestion on Layer 1 blockchains. Astar Network opted for the Polygon CDK (Custom Development Kit) to build their Layer 2 solution, Astar zkEVM, utilizing Validium for its off-chain data availability and modular architecture.

**Key Learnings from Astar Network Layer 2 Implementation**
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. **Scalability and Growth**: Henskens emphasized the significant scalability improvements achieved through the Layer 2 solution. By integrating with Polygon’s ecosystem, Astar Network could tap into a broader pool of liquidity and infrastructure support, facilitating faster growth and adoption.
2. **Infrastructure Control**: A critical lesson learned was the importance of maintaining control over infrastructure. Initially relying on external providers like Gelato for infrastructure services, Astar Network faced reliability issues. Transitioning to in-house infrastructure management resulted in a tenfold increase in scalability, underscoring the value of leveraging existing expertise from running Layer 1 operations.
3. **Security and Pen Testing**: Engaging with enterprises revealed stringent security requirements. Collaborating with industry leaders such as Sony, Astar Network underwent rigorous penetration testing and threat modeling, highlighting gaps in current Web3 security standards compared to traditional Web2 benchmarks.
4. **Interoperability and Cross-Chain Integration**: Astar Network’s efforts to ensure seamless interoperability between their Layer 1 and Layer 2 solutions were crucial. Partnerships with LayerZero facilitated the smooth transfer of assets between the two layers, enhancing user experience and ecosystem connectivity.

**Astar Network Challenges and Future Directions**
--------------------------------------------------

Henskens candidly addressed the challenges faced during the Layer 2 implementation, including the initial underestimation of the complexity involved in transitioning to a new tech stack. The importance of thorough testing and validation before deployment was a key takeaway, with the team actively exploring further integration with Substrate and Polkadot’s ecosystem to enhance interoperability and scalability.
