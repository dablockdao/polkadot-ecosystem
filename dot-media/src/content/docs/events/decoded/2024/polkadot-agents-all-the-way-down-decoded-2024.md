**At Polkadot Decoded 2024, the Web3 Foundation presented a comprehensive overview of their initiatives and future direction, with a focus on empowering independent agents within the Polkadot ecosystem.**

Thiago, a key figure at the Web3 Foundation, discussed the significant transformations and strategies undertaken by the foundation since his joining towards the end of the previous year. The presentation was structured around four main pillars: better technology, more capital, more agents, and more friends.

## Empowering Polkadot Ecosystem Agents
A central theme of the talk was the emphasis on agents—individuals or entities committed to furthering the Polkadot ecosystem **independently from core organizations like the Web3 Foundation and Parity Technologies**. Thiago highlighted a series of decentralized initiatives aimed at fostering a diverse and robust community of agents:
1. **Decentralized Futures**: Launched in December 2023, this **initiative focused on providing substantial funding to new agents in the ecosystem**. **With over 250 applications and around 45 million USD committed**, the program aimed to inject significant capital to support a variety of roles from developer relations to business development.
2. **Decentralized Voices**: Introduced in March 2024, this initiative aimed to distribute voting power to agents, **enhancing participation in the Polkadot governance process**. The first and second batches saw a notable improvement in the genie coefficient, reflecting a more equitable distribution of voting power.
3. **Upcoming Initiatives**: Thiago teased additional programs to be announced in the summer, continuing the foundation’s strategy to decentralize influence and resources within the Polkadot ecosystem.

## Polkadot Technological Advancements
The Web3 Foundation’s commitment to better technology was evident through their in-house research team, which focuses on a broad range of theoretical and applied blockchain topics. Highlights include:

- **ELVEs Protocol**: A newly published cryptoeconomic protocol to secure Polkadot, set to be presented at the upcoming Stanford blockchain conference.
- **Economics and Governance Overhaul**: Proposals to refine Polkadot’s economic and governance models, aiming to reduce inflation and simplify staking rewards and treasury inflows.

## Scytale Digital Capital Deployment
Addressing the challenge of raising early-stage venture funding in the **polkadot ecosystem**, Thiago announced a new Polkadot ecosystem fund in partnership with **Scytale Digital**. This fund, comprising both venture and liquid strategies, **aims to provide crucial capital to early-stage projects and liquidity to protocols**.

### Building Alliances
Recognizing the need for greater cross-pollination with other blockchain ecosystems, the **Web3 Foundation** is actively working to forge more alliances. A notable upcoming event is the Web3 Summit, scheduled for August in Berlin, designed to bring together diverse voices from across the Web3 space.
