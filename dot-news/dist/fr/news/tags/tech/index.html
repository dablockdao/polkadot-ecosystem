<p>The blockchain landscape is constantly evolving, with new technologies and frameworks emerging to address the growing demands for scalability, security, and interoperability. One of the most significant developments in this space is the <strong>integration of Substrate, the modular blockchain framework developed by Parity Technologies, into the Cardano ecosystem</strong>. This article explores the significance of the Cardano chain built on Substrate, highlighting its potential impact on the broader blockchain ecosystem and the synergies between Cardano and Polkadot.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-substrate-framework">What is Substrate Framework?</h2>
<p>Substrate is a highly customizable and modular framework designed to facilitate the creation of purpose-built blockchains. <strong>Developed by <a href="https://dablock.com/ecosystem/parity-technologies/">Parity Technologies</a>, Substrate provides developers with the tools and flexibility to create blockchains tailored to specific use cases without the need to build from scratch</strong>. Its modularity allows for the integration of various consensus mechanisms, governance models, and runtime environments, making it an ideal choice for projects looking to innovate in the blockchain space.</p>
<h2 id="cardanos-adoption-of-substrate-a-strategic-move">Cardano’s Adoption of Substrate: A Strategic Move</h2>
<p>The decision by <strong>IOHK</strong>, one of Cardano’s founding entities, to <strong>build the Cardano Partnerchain on Substrate</strong> marks a significant milestone in the evolution of both the Cardano and Polkadot ecosystems. Released on August 1st, 2024, the Cardano Partnerchain v1.0.0 represents the first instance of Cardano leveraging Substrate to enhance its blockchain infrastructure. This move is not only a testament to the versatility of Substrate but also a strategic decision that underscores the growing importance of interoperability and cross-chain collaboration in the blockchain industry.</p>
<h2 id="cardano-partnerchain-key-components">Cardano Partnerchain Key Components</h2>
<p>The Cardano Partnerchain v1.0.0 release includes two primary components: the <code dir="auto">partner-chains-node</code> and the <code dir="auto">partner-chains-cli</code>. The <code dir="auto">partner-chains-node</code> is a Substrate-based node binary specifically tailored for operating Cardano partner chains, while the <code dir="auto">partner-chains-cli</code> is a command-line interface wizard designed to simplify the configuration and management of these chains.</p>
<p>This release is compatible with various Cardano tools and components, including smart contracts, the Cardano node, and the Cardano DB Sync. The integration of Substrate into the Cardano ecosystem allows for greater flexibility in deploying and managing partner chains, paving the way for more innovative use cases and applications within the Cardano network.</p>
<h2 id="enhancing-interoperability-between-polkadot-and-cardano">Enhancing Interoperability Between Polkadot and Cardano</h2>
<p>One of the most exciting aspects of Cardano’s adoption of Substrate is the potential for <strong>enhanced interoperability between the Cardano and Polkadot ecosystems</strong>.<a href="https://dablock.com/news/cardano-polkadot-bridge-bridging-two-powerhouses-of-blockchain/"> See Polkadot &#x3C;> Cardano Bridge</a>. Polkadot, known for its relay chain and parachain architecture, has always emphasized the importance of cross-chain communication and interoperability. By building on Substrate, Cardano can leverage Polkadot’s interoperability features, enabling seamless communication and data transfer between Cardano-based chains and other Substrate-based blockchains.</p>
<p>This development also highlights the synergies between the Cardano and Polkadot ecosystems, particularly in their approach to governance and consensus mechanisms. Both ecosystems utilize a combination of Proof of Stake (PoS) and liquid democracy, allowing for more flexible and decentralized governance structures. The integration of Substrate into Cardano could lead to further collaboration between the two ecosystems, fostering innovation and the development of new blockchain applications that benefit from the strengths of both networks.</p>
<h2 id="the-role-of-substrate-in-expanding-the-cardano-ecosystem">The Role of Substrate in Expanding the Cardano Ecosystem</h2>
<p>The introduction of Substrate into the Cardano ecosystem is expected to play a crucial role in expanding the network’s capabilities and use cases. <strong>By utilizing Substrate, Cardano can more easily develop and deploy specialized blockchains, or “<em>partner chains</em>“</strong>, tailored to specific industries or applications. This modular approach allows for greater flexibility in designing blockchain solutions that meet the unique needs of various sectors, from finance and supply chain management to decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the ability to create and manage multiple partner chains within the Cardano ecosystem enhances the network’s scalability and resilience. As more partner chains are developed and integrated into the Cardano network, the overall capacity of the ecosystem to handle a diverse range of applications and use cases will increase, positioning Cardano as a leading blockchain platform in the years to come.</p>
<h2 id="cardano-potential-challenges-and-considerations">Cardano Potential Challenges and Considerations</h2>
<p>While the integration of Substrate into the Cardano ecosystem offers numerous benefits, it also presents several challenges that must be addressed. One of the primary concerns is the complexity of managing multiple partner chains within the Cardano network. As the number of partner chains grows, so too does the potential for network congestion and security vulnerabilities. To mitigate these risks, it will be essential for Cardano to implement robust governance and security mechanisms that can effectively manage the increased complexity of the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Another consideration is the potential for fragmentation within the Cardano ecosystem as more specialized partner chains are developed. While the modularity of Substrate allows for the creation of highly customized blockchains, it also increases the likelihood of fragmentation, where different partner chains may become isolated from one another. To address this issue, Cardano will need to prioritize interoperability and cross-chain communication between its partner chains, ensuring that the ecosystem remains cohesive and interconnected.</p>
<h2 id="the-future-of-cardano-on-substrate">The Future of Cardano on Substrate</h2>
<p>The decision to build the Cardano Partnerchain on Substrate represents a bold step forward for the Cardano ecosystem and a significant validation of the <a href="https://dablock.com/tech-talks/substrate-the-future-proof-blockchain-framework-sub0-2024/"><strong>Substrate framework</strong></a>. As the blockchain industry continues to evolve, the ability to create and manage specialized blockchains that can seamlessly interact with one another will become increasingly important. By leveraging Substrate, Cardano is positioning itself at the forefront of this trend, <strong>paving the way for a new era of interoperability, innovation, and collaboration in the blockchain space</strong>.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the continued development and refinement of the Cardano Partnerchain will be critical to the success of this initiative. As more projects and developers begin to explore the possibilities offered by Substrate, the Cardano ecosystem will likely see an influx of new ideas, applications, and partnerships. This, in turn, will drive further innovation and growth, solidifying Cardano’s position as a leading blockchain platform.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the integration of Substrate into the Cardano ecosystem marks a significant milestone in the evolution of blockchain technology and interoperability capabilities with the Polkadot ecosystem. By building on Substrate, Cardano is not only enhancing its own capabilities but also contributing to the broader blockchain ecosystem’s growth and development. As Cardano continues to explore the potential of Substrate, the possibilities for innovation and collaboration within the blockchain industry are virtually limitless.</p>

This article delves into the technical challenges, potential solutions, and the broader implications of <strong>building a bridge between Cardano and Polkadot</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-to-cardano-and-polkadot">Introduction to Cardano and Polkadot</h2>
<p>Cardano and Polkadot are among the top blockchain platforms, both designed to provide scalable and secure environments for decentralized applications (dApps). Cardano, created by Charles Hoskinson, known for its rigorous peer-reviewed research and layered architecture, aims to offer a sustainable and scalable blockchain. On the other hand, Polkadot, initially developed by <a href="https://dablock.com/ecosystem/parity-technologies/"><strong>Parity Technologies</strong></a> and <a href="https://dablock.com/ecosystem/web3-foundation/"><strong>Web3 Foundation</strong></a>, led by figures such as <a href="https://dablock.com/ecosystem/gavin-wood/"><strong>Gavin Wood</strong></a>, and now managed in a completely decentralized way by the community of token holders, focuses on i<strong>nteroperability and scalability</strong>, enabling different blockchains (parachains) to transfer messages and data seamlessly across its network.</p>
<h3 id="why-blockchain-interoperability-matters">Why Blockchain Interoperability Matters</h3>
<p>Interoperability between blockchains like Cardano and Polkadot is critical for fostering a more <strong>connected and user-friendly decentralized ecosystem</strong>. As the blockchain industry grows, the need for different networks to communicate with each other becomes increasingly important. This cross-chain interaction can unlock new use cases, reduce friction for users, and enable a more integrated and robust Web3 environment.</p>
<h2 id="technical-challenges-of-the-cardano--polkadot-bridge">Technical Challenges of the Cardano &#x3C;> Polkadot Bridge</h2>
<p>Building a bridge between two distinct blockchain platforms is no small feat. The Cardano &#x3C;> Polkadot bridge project faces several technical challenges, each requiring careful consideration and innovative solutions.</p>
<h3 id="consensus-mechanism-differences">Consensus Mechanism Differences</h3>
<p>One of the primary challenges lies in the differences between <strong>Cardano’s Ouroboros consensus</strong> protocol and <strong>Polkadot’s Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS) mechanism</strong>. Ouroboros, a proof-of-stake protocol, emphasizes security and energy efficiency, while Polkadot’s NPoS focuses on scalability and interoperability through its relay chain and parachain architecture. Bridging these two consensus mechanisms requires creating a <strong>system that can understand and validate the distinct blocks and signatures generated by each protocol</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="finality-and-transaction-speed">Finality and Transaction Speed</h3>
<p>Another significant challenge is ensuring transaction finality and speed. Cardano transactions typically achieve finality after a set number of confirmations. Polkadot, through its <strong>BABE</strong> and <strong>GRANDPA</strong> consensus algorithms, offers a different approach to finality. Synchronizing these two systems to achieve efficient cross-chain transactions without compromising on security is a complex task.</p>
<h3 id="light-client-implementation">Light Client Implementation</h3>
<p>The concept of a <a href="https://dablock.com/guides/introduction-to-polkadot-light-clients-guide/"><strong>light client</strong></a>—a simplified node that can interact with a full blockchain node without needing to download the entire blockchain—is central to the Cardano &#x3C;> Polkadot bridge. The light client must be able to verify transactions on both networks, ensuring that they meet the required consensus rules of each blockchain. This requires deep integration and understanding of both ecosystem’s cryptographic protocols and data structures.</p>
<h2 id="proposed-solutions-and-developments">Proposed Solutions and Developments</h2>
<p>Despite these challenges, several solutions have been proposed to facilitate the <strong>Cardano &#x3C;> Polkadot bridge</strong>. These solutions involve leveraging existing technologies within both ecosystems and innovating where necessary.</p>
<h3 id="using-mithril-for-cardano-verification">Using Mithril for Cardano Verification</h3>
<p><strong>Mithril</strong>, a research project by the Cardano Foundation, offers <strong>a potential solution for verifying Cardano transactions on the Polkadot network</strong>. Mithril provides stake-based threshold multisignatures, which allow a subset of Cardano validators to opt-in and provide signatures. This light client protocol could potentially reduce the time required for transaction finality, making the bridge more efficient.</p>
<h3 id="employing-beefy-for-polkadot-verification">Employing BEEFY for Polkadot Verification</h3>
<p>For the Polkadot to Cardano direction, the use of <strong>BEEFY (Bridge Enhanced Efficiency Finality Yield)</strong> proofs is proposed. BEEFY is a specialized consensus protocol designed by Polkadot to facilitate interoperability with other blockchains. It simplifies the export of validator set changes, enabling other chains, like Cardano, to verify Polkadot’s state with high efficiency.</p>
<h3 id="combining-sampling-and-snarks">Combining Sampling and SNARKs</h3>
<p>The bridge could also explore combining sampling-based approaches with succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (<strong>SNARKs</strong>) for enhanced security and efficiency. While Cardano’s current elliptic curve support limits the direct use of SNARKs, future updates could enable more advanced cryptographic techniques, further strengthening the bridge’s security.</p>
<h3 id="central-node-for-consensus-mechanism">Central Node for Consensus Mechanism</h3>
<p>Another innovative solution proposed within the community is the <strong>use of a central node or gear that interacts between both blockchains</strong>. This node would act as an intermediary, handling the consensus requirements of each blockchain while allowing users to interact with cross-chain transactions with minimal latency. Such a setup could potentially reduce the time required for transaction finalization and provide a smoother user experience.</p>
<h2 id="polkadot-and-cardano-community-and-ecosystem-collaboration">Polkadot and Cardano Community and Ecosystem Collaboration</h2>
<p><strong>The success of the Cardano &#x3C;> Polkadot bridge heavily depends on the collaboration between the two communities</strong>. Various stakeholders from both ecosystems, including developers, researchers, and validators, need to work together to overcome the technical challenges and build a robust bridge.</p>
<h3 id="cross-chain-development-initiatives">Cross-Chain Development Initiatives</h3>
<p>Several cross-chain development initiatives have already begun, with developers from both Cardano and Polkadot engaging in discussions and planning sessions. These initiatives aim to gather the necessary resources, expertise, and funding to move the project forward. For example, proposals have been submitted to both <strong>Cardano’s Project Catalyst</strong> and <strong>Polkadot’s OpenGov</strong> to secure funding for the bridge’s feasibility study and subsequent phases.</p>
<h3 id="hackathons-and-collaborative-events">Hackathons and Collaborative Events</h3>
<p>Hackathons and other collaborative events, such as the <a href="https://dablock.com/web3-events/web3-summit/"><strong>Web3 Summit</strong></a>, provide an excellent platform for developers to <strong>prototype and test components of the Cardano &#x3C;> Polkadot bridge</strong>. These events bring together talent from across the blockchain space, fostering innovation and accelerating the bridge’s development.</p>
<h3 id="challenges-and-setbacks">Challenges and Setbacks</h3>
<p>Despite the progress, the project has faced some setbacks, particularly in securing funding. Recent proposals submitted to Project Catalyst did not receive enough support to pass the minimum threshold for funding, <strong>prompting the team to revisit and improve their proposals for future funding rounds</strong>. This highlights the importance of clear communication, socialization of ideas, and community engagement in the success of such ambitious projects.</p>
<h2 id="the-broader-impact-of-the-cardano--polkadot-bridge">The Broader Impact of the Cardano &#x3C;> Polkadot Bridge</h2>
<p>The successful implementation of the Cardano &#x3C;> Polkadot bridge would have far-reaching implications for both ecosystems and the broader blockchain industry.</p>
<h3 id="enhanced-defi-and-nft-opportunities">Enhanced DeFi and NFT Opportunities</h3>
<p>With the bridge in place, users and developers would gain access to a broader range of <strong>decentralized finance (DeFi)</strong> applications and <strong>non-fungible tokens (NFTs)</strong> across both networks. This could lead to the creation of new cross-chain financial products, NFT marketplaces, and other dApps that leverage the unique features of both Cardano and Polkadot.</p>
<h3 id="strengthening-the-web3-ecosystem">Strengthening the Web3 Ecosystem</h3>
<p>Interoperability between Cardano and Polkadot would contribute to a more cohesive Web3 ecosystem. By enabling seamless communication between two of the most advanced blockchain platforms, <strong>the bridge would help break down silos within the blockchain space</strong>, fostering greater collaboration and innovation.</p>
<h3 id="long-term-vision-a-connected-blockchain-future">Long-Term Vision: A Connected Blockchain Future</h3>
<p>The Cardano &#x3C;> Polkadot bridge is a step toward a future where blockchain networks are interconnected, allowing users to move assets and data freely across different platforms. This vision aligns with the broader goals of Web3, where decentralization, interoperability, and user empowerment are at the forefront.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The <strong>Cardano &#x3C;> Polkadot bridge</strong> represents a significant milestone in the pursuit of blockchain interoperability. While the project faces considerable technical challenges, the proposed solutions and collaborative efforts from both communities offer a promising path forward. As the bridge progresses from feasibility studies to a fully functional product, it will not only benefit the Cardano and Polkadot ecosystems but also pave the way for a more interconnected and robust Web3 landscape.</p>

Announced on July 31, 2024, this update introduces groundbreaking features aimed at enhancing throughput and performance across the network.</p>
<h2 id="key-features-of-the-elastic-scaling-mvp">Key Features of the Elastic Scaling MVP</h2>
<p>The latest release, identified as stable2407 1, <strong>integrates support for elastic scaling into the Cumulus node</strong>. This new functionality allows parachains to leverage up to three cores per relay chain block. As a result, parachains can now experience up to three times the throughput compared to previous capabilities, with block times reduced to just two seconds.</p>
<h2 id="polkadot-relay-chain-enhancements">Polkadot Relay Chain Enhancements</h2>
<p>From a relay chain perspective, the elastic scaling functionality is fully implemented and currently <strong>active on the Westend and Rococo testnets</strong>. This feature represents a major step forward in Polkadot’s scalability efforts. However, due to security considerations, <strong>all nodes (collators) of an elastic parachain are required to be trusted</strong>. Collators must now announce or gossip blocks only to trusted nodes, necessitating a temporary private network setup until further RFC updates are completed.</p>
<h3 id="collator-adjustments">Collator Adjustments</h3>
<p>Elastic scaling support for collators is accessible via a new, experimental slot-based collator mode. This functionality can be enabled using the node CLI switch: <code dir="auto">--experimental-use-slot-based</code>. Despite these advancements, it is important to note that the cumulus block authorship and import pipelines are not yet optimized for elastic scaling. Consequently, the maximum achievable throughput is influenced by the number of collators and their networking latency.</p>
<p>Currently, the maximum throughput achievable with elastic scaling is observed when using a single collator. In such cases, the system can achieve 1.3 seconds of execution and 5MB Proof of Validity (PoV) per parachain block, translating to a total execution time of 2.6 seconds for each relay chain block. Adding multiple collators to the set reduces the maximum execution time per block, though testing indicates that the optimal throughput with multiple collators is achievable with two cores.</p>
<h3 id="future-developments">Future Developments</h3>
<p>The Polkadot development team is committed to further optimizing the cumulus block authorship process to improve throughput limitations. The ongoing work, detailed in the GitHub issue <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/5190">Elastic Scaling: Streamlined Block Production</a>, aims to address current inefficiencies and enhance overall performance.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started-with-elastic-scaling">Getting Started with Elastic Scaling</h2>
<p>For developers looking to experiment with the new elastic scaling features, the following prerequisites are necessary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Polkadot binary stable2407 1</li>
<li>Polkadot-parachain binary stable2407 1</li>
<li>Latest Zombienet release</li>
</ul>
<p>A sample test for elastic scaling is available in the <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/0000-cumulus-3cores.zndsl">Zombienet tests</a>. This test spins up a Rococo development relay chain with three validators and one parachain, utilizing updated runtime support as per the documentation. Developers can run the test using the provided JavaScript script to assign cores to the parachain.</p>
<p>For those using the Polkadot parachain node template, additional instructions for incorporating elastic scaling node support can be found <a href="https://forum.polkadot.network/t/elastic-scaling-mvp-launched/9392">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>The launch of the elastic scaling MVP is a significant milestone for the Polkadot ecosystem, offering enhanced performance and scalability for parachains. As development continues, further optimizations are expected to refine and expand these capabilities, reinforcing Polkadot’s commitment to advancing blockchain technology.</p>

In <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>July 2025</strong></span>, the highly anticipated launch of <a href="https://dablock.com/polkadot-jam-chain/"><strong>JAM (Join Accumulate Machine)</strong></a> is expected to usher in a new era of blockchain technology within the Polkadot ecosystem. Although it is normal to see delays in these launches, so take the date of July 2025 only as a reference.</p>
<p>The initiative, spearheaded by <a href="https://dablock.com/ecosystem/gavin-wood/"><strong>Polkadot founder Gavin Wood</strong></a>, has already sparked considerable interest within the blockchain community. With an impressive prize pool of 10 million DOT tokens and 100,000 KSM tokens—valued at over $60 million USD—up for grabs, developers worldwide are gearing up to participate in the <a href="https://dablock.com/news/shape-polkadots-future-with-the-jam-prize-10m-dot/"><strong>JAM Prize competition</strong></a>, aiming to create robust client implementations that enhance Polkadot’s network resilience.</p>
<p>The launch of JAM represents a significant leap in Polkadot’s ongoing evolution, pushing the boundaries of what blockchain technology can achieve. For years, Polkadot has been at the forefront of decentralization, interoperability, and scalability. However, JAM is poised to take these capabilities to the next level by offering a <strong>more flexible and efficient infrastructure layer</strong>, moving away from the rigid limitations of parachains and fostering a more seamless integration for developers.</p>
<h2 id="the-vision-behind-jam-a-decentralized-future">The Vision Behind JAM: A Decentralized Future</h2>
<p>Polkadot has always aimed to build a truly decentralized and resilient blockchain network, but the path to achieving that vision has not been without challenges. The introduction of JAM is a direct response to some of the hurdles faced by developers and users within the current blockchain ecosystem. One of the main issues Polkadot has identified is the need for a more flexible platform that allows developers to build solutions without the necessity of creating or maintaining their own blockchains.</p>
<p>Until now, most integrations within the Polkadot ecosystem have relied heavily on parachains, <strong>parallel blockchains that run alongside Polkadot and are connected through the Relay chain</strong>. While this architecture provides a high level of security and scalability, it has also created<span style="color: #ff0000;"> <strong>fragmentation and alignment issues</strong></span>, especially for early-stage projects. Many developers have found it difficult to leverage existing parachains effectively, often dedicating significant resources to building chains even when their applications didn’t require a full blockchain.</p>
<p>JAM is Polkadot’s answer to these limitations, offering a more flexible and scalable infrastructure that allows for broader use cases and easier integration. <strong>With JAM, developers are no longer restricted to parachains</strong> but can work within a more decentralized and less opinionated infrastructure layer, creating an ecosystem that is far more adaptable to diverse needs.</p>
<h2 id="jams-core-features-a-deep-dive">JAM’s Core Features: A Deep Dive</h2>
<p><a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>
At the heart of the JAM initiative lies a robust protocol designed to optimize the performance, security, and adaptability of the Polkadot network. While the JAM protocol is backward compatible with existing Polkadot architecture, it introduces several new features that promise to revolutionize how developers build and scale decentralized applications (dApps).</p>
<h3 id="backwards-compatibility">Backwards Compatibility</h3>
<p>JAM has been engineered to ensure that developers and users can <strong>transition seamlessly from Polkadot’s current Relay chain architecture to the new JAM protocol</strong>. Backward compatibility means that all existing parachains, smart contracts, and applications will continue to function as intended, without requiring major rewrites or migrations. This is critical for maintaining the continuity and stability of the Polkadot ecosystem as it evolves toward JAM.</p>
<h3 id="redundancy-of-the-relay-chain">Redundancy of the Relay Chain</h3>
<p>One of the more radical changes introduced by JAM is the redundancy of the Relay chain. With the deployment of JAM, the Relay chain, which has historically played a central role in securing the Polkadot network, will no longer be necessary. <strong>Validators who previously secured the Relay chain can migrate to the new JAM-based architecture</strong>. While it’s possible to continue running the Relay chain via hard forks, validators will no longer receive rewards unless they transition to the new system.</p>
<p>This shift underscores Polkadot’s vision of decentralizing the core functions of its network, distributing security and economic functions across a more flexible and resilient infrastructure. By eliminating the dependency on a central security chain, JAM aims to enhance the scalability and efficiency of the entire Polkadot ecosystem.</p>
<h3 id="optimized-resource-allocation">Optimized Resource Allocation</h3>
<p>JAM’s protocol upgrades also aim to streamline resource allocation across the Polkadot network. <strong>By decentralizing extraneous functionalities that were previously tied to the Relay chain</strong>, JAM allows for more efficient use of computational resources. This optimization is particularly important for large-scale enterprise solutions and dApps that require high levels of performance and security.</p>
<h3 id="enhanced-security-and-resilience">Enhanced Security and Resilience</h3>
<p>Security has always been a top priority for Polkadot, and JAM continues this tradition by incentivizing the development of multiple client implementations. <strong>The <a href="https://dablock.com/news/shape-polkadots-future-with-the-jam-prize-10m-dot/">JAM Prize</a> encourages developers to create implementations in various programming languages</strong>, ensuring that the network is not overly reliant on any single client or programming language. This diversity of implementations significantly enhances network resilience, <strong>reducing the risk of vulnerabilities that could arise from monoculture in software</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="the-jam-supercomputer-testing-the-future">The JAM Supercomputer: Testing the Future</h2>
<p>One of the most exciting aspects of the JAM initiative is the <a href="https://dablock.com/news/the-jam-toaster-testing-at-scale-for-the-future-of-blockchain/"><strong>JAM Supercomputer</strong></a>, also known as the JAM Toaster. Unveiled in Lisbon earlier this year, this state-of-the-art system is designed to run the Polkadot Virtual Machine (PVM) and serve as a centralized testing hub for the JAM network. With 12,276 cores and 16 TB of RAM, the JAM Toaster is a computational powerhouse capable of simulating the entire JAM network’s functionality before full deployment.</p>
<p>The JAM Supercomputer is not just a testing environment; it’s a critical tool for developers aiming to optimize their JAM implementations. By leveraging the Toaster’s vast computational resources, developers can conduct extensive testing, experimentation, and optimization to ensure that their solutions are scalable and secure.</p>
<h3 id="global-node-distribution">Global Node Distribution</h3>
<p>In addition to the JAM Toaster, Polkadot plans to deploy a distributed network of 1,023 nodes worldwide. These nodes collectively replicate the behavior of the JAM network, allowing for more comprehensive testing across different geographical locations and network conditions. This distributed network will <strong>simulate the processing power of 341 cores</strong>, providing developers with a highly accurate and scalable testing environment.</p>
<h3 id="top-tier-computing-power">Top-Tier Computing Power</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://dablock.com/news/the-jam-toaster-testing-at-scale-for-the-future-of-blockchain/"><strong>JAM Supercomputer</strong></a> and its distributed nodes are expected to rank among the top 500–1000 supercomputers globally, a testament to the technological significance and computational power of the JAM initiative. By leveraging this advanced infrastructure, Polkadot is setting the stage for a new era of decentralized network validation and scalability.</p>

This landmark achievement paves the way for a new level of interoperability and functionality within the Polkadot ecosystem, enabling developers to leverage the robust capabilities of the Move programming language while building on Substrate networks. This article delves into the significance of this integration, the technical intricacies involved, and the broader implications for the blockchain community.</p>
<h2 id="background-of-move-and-substrate">Background of Move and Substrate</h2>
<p>Move is a highly secure and verified programming language, originally developed by Diem (formerly known as Facebook’s Libra) and has gained traction with blockchains like Sui and Aptos. It was designed as a platform-agnostic language, emphasizing security and formal verification to ensure robust smart contract execution.</p>
<p>Substrate, on the other hand, is a modular framework that enables the creation of purpose-built blockchains. As the underlying framework for Polkadot, Substrate provides developers with the tools to create custom blockchains with interoperability at their core. The integration of Move VM into Substrate signifies a convergence of these two powerful technologies.</p>
<h2 id="achieving-compatibility-the-technical-journey">Achieving Compatibility: The Technical Journey</h2>
<p>The process of integrating Move VM with Substrate involved several technical milestones. The team at Eiger Co. adapted the existing Diem-based Move VM to achieve full compatibility within the Substrate runtime. This adaptation was not merely a straightforward port but required substantial modification and optimization to ensure seamless operation within the Substrate environment.</p>
<p><strong>MoveVM Adaptation:</strong> The original Move VM was forked and adapted to be fully compatible with Substrate. Key steps included:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Backend Interface:</strong> Providing a simplified Move VM backend interface with full no-std support, encapsulating all Move VM handling operations.</li>
<li><strong>Storage and Address Mapping:</strong> Establishing a direct mapping between the 32-byte address space in Move VM storage and Substrate accounts.</li>
<li><strong>Move Smart Contract Compiler:</strong> Setting up a dedicated compiler and package tool capable of supporting SS58 accounts, essential for preparing Move smart contracts for execution within the Substrate runtime.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pallet Move Design:</strong> The Move pallet is central to this integration, allowing the publishing and execution of Move modules and scripts. Three critical extrinsic calls were defined:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>execute(origin, transaction_bc, gas_limit, cheque_limit):</strong> Facilitates the execution of Move scripts, supporting multiple signers.</li>
<li><strong>publish_module(origin, bytecode, gas_limit):</strong> Enables the publishing of individual Move modules.</li>
<li><strong>publish_module_bundle(origin, bundle, gas_limit):</strong> Allows the publishing of bundled Move modules.</li>
</ul>
<p>These calls are designed to integrate seamlessly with the Substrate runtime, translating signed origins into authorized Move account access and managing the execution parameters.</p>
<h2 id="gas-costs-and-benchmarking">Gas Costs and Benchmarking</h2>
<p>A significant aspect of the integration was establishing a balanced gas cost system. The Move VM calculates gas costs for each instruction, which are then converted to Substrate weights, translating into blockchain fees. This linear relationship between Move VM gas and Substrate weights ensures transparent and predictable cost management for developers and users.</p>
<p>Eiger Co. conducted extensive benchmarking to fine-tune this relationship. By using parameterized Substrate benchmark functions and Move example code, they achieved an almost perfectly linear correlation between gas costs and Substrate weights. This precision allows for accurate gas estimation and cost management, further enhancing the usability of Move on Substrate-based networks.</p>
<h2 id="implications-for-the-blockchain-ecosystem">Implications for the Blockchain Ecosystem</h2>
<p>The integration of Move VM with Substrate unlocks a plethora of opportunities for developers and the broader blockchain ecosystem. Key benefits include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enhanced Interoperability:</strong> Developers can now create Move-based smart contracts that operate seamlessly within the Polkadot ecosystem, facilitating cross-chain interactions and broadening the scope of decentralized applications (dApps).</li>
<li><strong>Security and Verification:</strong> Move’s emphasis on security and formal verification aligns with the high standards of the Substrate framework, ensuring robust and reliable smart contract execution.</li>
<li><strong>Developer Flexibility:</strong> The ability to leverage Move’s capabilities within Substrate provides developers with greater flexibility in choosing the best tools for their specific needs, fostering innovation and diversity in blockchain solutions.</li>

A recent proposal by <strong>Robert Habermeier</strong>, a key figure in the <a href="https://dablock.com/ecosystem/"><strong>Polkadot ecosystem</strong></a>, introduces a transformative vision for a new system chain, codenamed <em>“Polkadot Plaza.”</em> This concept aims to consolidate various functionalities into a single, highly scalable chain that could serve as a central hub for users, developers, liquidity, and applications within the Polkadot ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id="the-vision-behind-polkadot-plaza">The Vision Behind Polkadot Plaza</h2>
<p><em>Polkadot Plaza</em> is designed to be an evolution of the existing <em><strong>Polkadot AssetHub chain</strong></em>. Currently, the ecosystem splits functionalities—such as asset issuance, smart contracts, staking, and bridging—across different chains. This fragmentation has led to increased complexity for users and developers alike. Habermeier’s proposal suggests that by consolidating these features into a single system chain, Polkadot can create a <strong>more user-friendly and developer-centric environment</strong>, maximizing the use of the network’s resources.</p>
<h2 id="key-features-of-polkadot-plaza">Key Features of Polkadot Plaza</h2>
<p>Habermeier outlines several core functionalities that Polkadot Plaza would integrate:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Asset Issuance:</strong> Building on the existing capabilities of AssetHub, Plaza would continue to support asset issuance, maintaining the momentum of current integrations.</li>
<li><strong>Smart Contracts (via RISC-V/PolkaVM):</strong> The proposal includes support for both Rust-based smart contracts (via Ink!) and EVM-compatible contracts, enabling developers to use familiar tools within the Polkadot ecosystem. This would significantly lower the barriers to entry for deploying smart contracts on Polkadot.</li>
<li><strong>Staking:</strong> While staking currently occurs on the Relay Chain, Polkadot Plaza would introduce native staking capabilities, enhancing security and decentralization.</li>
<li><strong>Bridging Pallets:</strong> Plaza would integrate bridging pallets, currently managed by BridgeHub, facilitating seamless interoperability between Polkadot and other blockchain networks.</li>
<li><strong>Near-Zero Fees:</strong> To remain competitive, Polkadot Plaza aims to minimize transaction fees, especially during the initial phases, until scaling limits are reached.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="polkadot-plaza-addressing-fragmentation-and-complexity">Polkadot Plaza Addressing Fragmentation and Complexity</h2>
<p>One of the primary challenges in the current Polkadot ecosystem is the complexity associated with interacting across multiple chains. Users must manage assets, accounts, and states across different platforms, while developers face significant overhead in building, maintaining, and integrating chains. Polkadot Plaza seeks to simplify these processes by offering a unified platform where most interactions can occur, reducing the need for coordination across disparate chains.</p>
<p>This approach contrasts with the current trend of asynchronous composability, where functionalities are spread across various chains. While this model may be necessary once scaling limits are reached, Habermeier argues that a more strategic focus on usability is required in the interim. By concentrating resources on a synchronous, composable system chain, <strong>Polkadot can better serve its growing user base and developer community</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="leveraging-elastic-scaling-for-massive-throughput">Leveraging Elastic Scaling for Massive Throughput</h4>
<p>With the advent of Elastic Scaling, Polkadot will soon be able to process a large number of transactions in parallel across multiple cores. Polkadot Plaza is poised to take full advantage of this capability, <strong>potentially scaling to thousands of transactions per second (TPS)</strong> in the short term and much higher volumes over time. This scalability would allow Polkadot to accommodate tens of millions of daily users, making it a formidable competitor to other blockchain platforms.</p>
<h2 id="value-accrual-and-the-future-of-dot">Value Accrual and the Future of DOT</h2>
<p>Another significant aspect of the Polkadot Plaza proposal is the potential for value accrual to the DOT token. Habermeier suggests implementing a priority fee mechanism, where users can pay for transaction ordering priority. This approach could capture value even in a system where the average transaction fee is near zero. The revenue generated from these priority fees could be used to burn DOT tokens, potentially increasing their value over time.</p>

<h2 id="the-path-forward-for-polkadot-plaza">The Path Forward for Polkadot Plaza</h2>
<p>Habermeier’s proposal is the first step towards formalizing Polkadot Plaza as a central component of the Polkadot ecosystem. The next steps will involve several referendums within Polkadot’s governance framework to approve and implement the necessary changes. These include renaming AssetHub to reflect its broader purpose, scaling Plaza using Polkadot cores, and integrating additional features like smart contracts and priority fees.</p>
<p>Additionally, the proposal envisions making Polkadot Plaza a focal point for marketing, developer relations, and educational programs within the ecosystem. By doing so, Polkadot can create a thriving environment that attracts new users and developers, fostering innovation and growth.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Staking on Polkadot involves locking tokens to support the network’s operations and, in return, earning rewards. However, one of the challenges that stakers face is the unbonding period, <strong>currently set at a fixed 28 days</strong>. This period is crucial for maintaining the security of the network, as it allows enough time to detect and penalize any malicious activities by validators whose tokens are backing the network.</p>
<p><strong>The 28-day unbonding period is one of the longest among proof-of-stake protocols</strong>, which, while ensuring high security, also poses limitations on liquidity and deters potential participants who prioritize flexibility.</p>
<h2 id="the-proposed-polkadot-flexible-unbonding-mechanism">The Proposed Polkadot Flexible Unbonding Mechanism</h2>
<p><strong>The new RFC proposes a dynamic unbonding period that adapts to the current state of the network</strong>. The unbonding time would scale according to the volume of unbonding requests, <strong>with a minimum period of 2 days and a maximum of 28 days</strong>. This approach aims to make staking more attractive by offering a quicker exit option during times of low unbonding demand, while still maintaining the traditional 28-day period during high demand to ensure security.</p>
<p>The mechanism is designed to queue unbonding requests and adjust their duration based on the size of the queue. When the queue is short, users can expect to unbond their tokens within 2 days. As the queue grows, the unbonding time increases, up to the maximum of 28 days. This system ensures that a substantial portion of the stake remains available for slashing in case of validator misbehavior, thereby maintaining network security.</p>
<h2 id="security-considerations">Security Considerations</h2>
<p>The security of the Polkadot network relies heavily on the unbonding period, particularly in preventing <strong>long-range attacks (LRAs)</strong>. These attacks become theoretically possible if more than one-third of the validators collude to deceive the network. The proposed mechanism maintains robust defenses against such attacks by ensuring that even during periods of low unbonding times, <strong>enough stake remains locked to deter malicious behavior</strong>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <strong>the new unbonding mechanism is sensitive to large unbonding events</strong>, which are typically associated with major network activities like parachain auctions. During these events, the unbonding time will naturally extend, <strong>ensuring that the network’s security</strong> remains uncompromised.</p>
<h2 id="impact-on-polkadot-stakeholders">Impact on Polkadot Stakeholders</h2>
<p>The introduction of a flexible unbonding period is expected to <strong>benefit all DOT/KSM token holders</strong>. It offers greater flexibility and enhances the user experience by allowing quicker access to tokens when the network is less congested. At the same time, it preserves the high level of security that Polkadot is known for, making it an attractive option for both current and potential stakers.</p>

<h2 id="future-implementation-and-testing">Future Implementation and Testing</h2>
<p>The RFC recommends that this new unbonding mechanism be <strong>first implemented and tested on Kusama</strong>, Polkadot’s canary network. Kusama’s more experimental environment allows for real-world testing of the new system’s stability and effectiveness. Following successful trials, the mechanism could be integrated into the Polkadot mainnet, with appropriate adjustments to the parameters.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Polkadot’s proposed flexible unbonding mechanism represents a significant evolution in staking. By introducing a <strong>Polkadot staking</strong> <strong>dynamic unbonding period</strong>, the network aims to <strong>enhance its competitiveness and attract more participants</strong>, all while maintaining its reputation for security. As the blockchain space continues to evolve, such innovations are crucial in ensuring that networks like Polkadot remain at the forefront of the industry.</p>

This proposal has sparked considerable debate within the community, highlighting the dynamic nature of Polkadot’s governance and its commitment to adapting to the evolving needs of its stakeholders.</p>
<h2 id="polkadot-token-dot-inflation-background">Polkadot Token DOT Inflation Background</h2>
<p>Inflation in blockchain networks like Polkadot serves several critical purposes. Primarily, it ensures the economic security of the network by incentivizing validators who play a vital role in maintaining the network’s integrity. Additionally, inflation funds the treasury, which supports ecosystem development and community-driven projects. Since its inception, Polkadot has maintained a 10% inflation rate, a figure deemed necessary to attract and retain a <strong>robust set of <a href="https://dablock.com/polkadot-validators/">Polkadot network validators</a> during the network’s early stages</strong>.</p>
<p>However, as the network matures, there is a growing discourse around sustainability and long-term economic health. Many in the community have voiced concerns that the current inflation rate may no longer be necessary or optimal. This has led to the proposal to reduce the inflation rate to 5%, a move that proponents argue would strike a balance between incentivizing validators and ensuring the long-term value retention of <strong>DOT</strong>, Polkadot’s native token.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Changing Polkadot’s inflation isn’t as straightforward as it seems.</p>
<p>Everyone’s talking about the big drop and potential upside, but there’s more to it than that.</p>

<h2 id="the-proposal-to-reduce-polkadot-inflation">The Proposal to Reduce Polkadot Inflation</h2>
<p>The proposal, which has garnered significant attention, suggests a reduction in the annual inflation rate from the current 10% to 5%. This reduction would likely result in a more conservative issuance of new tokens, thereby reducing the potential dilution of existing holders’ stakes. Importantly, this proposal also seeks to empower the community by making the parameters of inflation more flexible and subject to governance decisions.</p>
<p>One of the critical elements of this proposal is the <strong>introduction of a fixed treasury inflow mechanism</strong>. This mechanism would decouple treasury funding from the staking rate, ensuring a steady flow of resources to the treasury regardless of fluctuations in staking activity. Such a change could provide greater financial predictability and stability for funding ecosystem development projects.</p>
<h2 id="governance-and-community-engagement">Governance and Community Engagement</h2>
<p>The process of potentially reducing DOT inflation is a testament to Polkadot’s decentralized governance framework. The proposal is currently under discussion in the Polkadot forums, where community members can weigh in on the merits and potential drawbacks of the change. If the community reaches a consensus, the proposal will proceed to a referendum, allowing DOT holders to vote on the issue directly.</p>
<p>This governance model, which empowers the community to make critical decisions about the network’s future, is a cornerstone of Polkadot’s philosophy. By making inflation parameters adjustable through governance, the network can remain responsive to the community’s evolving needs, adapting to changes in the ecosystem while maintaining transparency and fairness.</p>
<h2 id="implications-for-the-polkadot-ecosystem">Implications for the Polkadot Ecosystem</h2>
<p>If adopted, the reduction in DOT inflation could have several far-reaching implications. For one, it could enhance the long-term value proposition of DOT by limiting supply dilution, which could be attractive to both existing holders and potential new investors. Additionally, by securing a more predictable treasury funding mechanism, the network could ensure sustained support for vital projects and initiatives within the ecosystem.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the proposal also acknowledges the need to continue incentivizing validators to maintain the network’s security. The proposed changes are designed to ensure that the reduction in inflation does not undermine these incentives, preserving the integrity and performance of the network.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>The ongoing discussion about reducing Polkadot’s inflation rate to 5% underscores the network’s commitment to sustainability and responsive governance. As the proposal moves through the community and towards a potential referendum, it will be crucial for all stakeholders to engage in the debate, weighing the long-term benefits against any potential risks.</p>
<p>This potential adjustment is not just a financial tweak but a strategic evolution, reflecting Polkadot’s mission to create a flexible, secure, and inclusive blockchain network that can adapt to the future needs of its diverse community.</p> </div> <footer class="astro-dr56dw7m"> <div class="astro-sg3lsd66"><b class="astro-sg3lsd66">Étiquettes :</b><ul class="astro-sg3lsd66"><li class="astro-sg3lsd66"><a href="/fr/news/tags/tech" class="astro-sg3lsd66">tech</a></li></ul></div> </footer> </article> <article class="preview astro-dr56dw7m"> <header class="astro-dr56dw7m"> <h2 class="astro-dr56dw7m"> <a href="/fr/news/securing-polkadot-quantum-generated-randomness" class="astro-dr56dw7m">Securing Polkadot with Quantum-Generated Randomness?</a> </h2> <div class="metadata not-content astro-2oxtfctb"> <div class="dates astro-2oxtfctb"> <time datetime="2024-02-17T00:00:00.000Z" class="astro-2oxtfctb"> 17 févr. 2024 </time>  </div>   </div>  </header> <div class="sl-markdown-content astro-dr56dw7m"> <p>The Polkadot ecosystem has long been recognized for its innovative approach to blockchain technology, particularly through its use of the Substrate framework. As the digital world progresses towards greater security and efficiency, the need for verifiable randomness becomes increasingly critical. Traditional randomness generation methods often fall short in providing the unpredictability required for robust security protocols, particularly in the face of emerging quantum computing technologies. This article explores the integration of true quantum-based randomness into the Polkadot ecosystem, focusing on its potential benefits, challenges, and the broader implications for the Web3 community.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-quantum-randomness">Understanding Quantum Randomness</h2>
<p><strong>Randomness is a fundamental component of cryptographic systems</strong>, essential for secure communications, privacy, and fairness in decentralized networks. Traditional randomness generation techniques, such as <strong><em>pseudo-random number generators</em> (PRNGs)</strong>, rely on deterministic algorithms, making them susceptible to prediction and manipulation. While current non-quantum methods, like those based on threshold BLS or Verifiable Random Functions (VRFs), are effective, they are not immune to the advances in quantum computing, which could potentially break these systems.</p>
<p><strong>Quantum randomness, on the other hand, is derived from the inherent unpredictability of quantum mechanical processes</strong>. Specifically, quantum random number generators (QRNGs) leverage phenomena like quantum entanglement and superposition to produce truly random outcomes that cannot be predicted, even by the most sophisticated algorithms. This randomness is fundamentally different from the pseudo-randomness generated by classical computers, offering a higher degree of security and trust.</p>
<h3 id="the-quantum-experiment-a-leap-towards-true-randomness">The Quantum Experiment: A Leap Towards True Randomness</h3>
<p>Recent developments in quantum technology have made it feasible to generate randomness that is certified by quantum principles. A prominent example is the experiment conducted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which <strong>utilizes a loophole-free Bell test to produce randomness certified by the impossibility of superluminal signals</strong>. This experiment involves entangled photons, where the outcomes of measurements on these photons are fundamentally unpredictable. The randomness generated from such experiments is not only true in the quantum mechanical sense but also verifiable, providing a new level of security assurance for blockchain applications.</p>
<p><strong>In collaboration with the University of Colorado, Ideal Labs raised the idea to bring this quantum-generated randomness into the Polkadot ecosystem</strong>. The project involves integrating the output from a quantum random number generator into Polkadot’s decentralized protocols, offering an unprecedented level of randomness that is future-proof against quantum attacks.</p>
<h2 id="quantum-randomness-integration-with-polkadot">Quantum Randomness Integration with Polkadot</h2>
<p>Integrating quantum randomness into Polkadot could have far-reaching implications for the ecosystem. Firstly, <strong>it would enhance the security of various protocols that rely on randomness, such as consensus mechanisms, cryptographic key generation, and smart contract execution</strong>. By ensuring that the randomness used in these processes is truly unpredictable, the integrity of the network is significantly bolstered, making it more resilient to attacks.</p>
<p>Moreover, <strong>this integration showcases the flexibility and technical superiority of the Substrate framework</strong>, which powers Polkadot. Substrate’s modular architecture allows for the seamless incorporation of cutting-edge technologies like quantum randomness, positioning Polkadot as a leader in the next generation of blockchain innovation. This move could also pave the way for further collaborations between the blockchain and quantum computing communities, opening up new avenues for research and development.</p>
<h3 id="challenges-and-considerations">Challenges and Considerations</h3>
<p>While the benefits of integrating quantum randomness into Polkadot are clear, several challenges must be addressed. One of the primary concerns is the <strong>centralization risk associated with QRNGs</strong>. Currently, <strong>there are only a limited number of devices capable of generating quantum randomness</strong>, and their deployment is still in its early stages. This raises concerns about the potential for centralization if the network relies too heavily on a few quantum sources.</p>
<p>To mitigate this risk, <strong>it is essential to develop decentralized methods for distributing quantum randomness</strong>. One approach could involve using a network of QRNGs distributed across different geographical locations and organizations, ensuring that no single entity has control over the randomness source. Additionally, integrating quantum randomness with existing decentralized randomness schemes, such as those based on Verifiable Random Functions (VRFs), could provide a hybrid solution that leverages the strengths of both approaches.</p>
<p>Another challenge lies in the verification of quantum randomness. While the randomness generated by a quantum experiment is theoretically verifiable, <strong>implementing a practical verification process within the Polkadot ecosystem requires careful consideration</strong>. The verification script must be adapted to the blockchain environment, possibly re-implemented in <strong>Rust and made WebAssembly (Wasm) compatible</strong>, ensuring that the output can be publicly and securely verified on-chain.</p>
<h3 id="potential-partnerships-and-future-directions">Potential Partnerships and Future Directions</h3>
<p>The collaboration between Ideal Labs and the University of Colorado represents just the beginning of what could be a <strong>broader partnership between the blockchain and quantum computing communities</strong>. As quantum technology continues to advance, there are numerous opportunities for further integration of quantum principles into the Polkadot ecosystem. For instance, the concept of an “entropy mesh,” a distributed network of quantum randomness sources, could be explored to enhance the security and scalability of blockchain protocols.</p>
<p>Moreover, the adoption of quantum randomness in Polkadot could serve as a model for other blockchain platforms, encouraging the industry to embrace quantum technologies as a means of future-proofing against emerging threats. This integration could also lead to new use cases for blockchain in areas where security and randomness are paramount, such as secure multi-party computation, privacy-preserving protocols, and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.</p>

<p>The Polkadot and Kusama networks have achieved a significant milestone with the launch of a live bridge, <strong>connecting the Polkadot Bridge Hub and Kusama Bridge Hub</strong> through a transport protocol. This innovative bridge employs <strong>GRANDPA light-clients</strong> for both networks, facilitating real-time synchronization currently being synced live by a Parity-run permissionless relayer. This system ensures trustless messaging and chain progress tracking between Polkadot and Kusama, controlled solely by their respective governance structures.</p>
<p>The bridge supports a robust and decentralized relayer network through its relayer protocol and incentivization mechanism, encouraging community participation. Initially, it features a single “lane” for XCM communication primarily for DOT &#x26; KSM transfers, with plans to expand to stablecoins and eventually allow any asset owner to register their asset as a <strong>ForeignAsset</strong>.</p>
<p>A demo showcasing a KSM transfer from Kusama Asset Hub (KAH) to Polkadot Asset Hub (PAH) highlights the operational capabilities of the bridge, including the manual crafting of XCM transfers. Following the transfer, the KSM is recognized as a foreign asset in the recipient’s PAH account, marking a <strong>successful cross-chain asset transfer</strong>.</p>
<p>Future developments aim to integrate <strong>wallet support for PAH &#x3C;> KAH transfers</strong>, <strong>reduce bridge transfer fees</strong>, and <strong>implement a permissioned way for parachains to open lanes directly</strong>, bypassing governance procedures. These enhancements are designed to improve the user experience and facilitate easier asset transfers across the Polkadot and Kusama networks.</p>

This approach can be seen as a new option rather than just a variation of the original proposal.</p>
<h2 id="impact-on-original-proposal-options"><strong>Impact on Original Proposal Options:</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Expansion of Scope:</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Original Proposal:</strong> Focuses on unifying address formats for compatible Polkadot parachains by using prefix <code dir="auto">0</code> (usually starting with ‘1’) and suggests using prefix <code dir="auto">42</code> (usually starting with ‘5’) for standalone Substrate chains.</li>
<li><strong>Extended Proposal:</strong> Advocates for all Substrate-based chains, including independent ones like Aleph Zero and The Root Network, to adopt the same SS58 prefix (e.g., prefix <code dir="auto">0</code>).</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Standardization Across Chains:</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>By using the same prefix, all Substrate-based chains would display addresses in an identical format. This eliminates the need for different prefixes and reduces fragmentation not just within Polkadot but across all Substrate networks.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>User Experience Enhancement:</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>A single address format simplifies the user experience significantly. Users would no longer need to manage different address formats when interacting with different Substrate-based chains, reducing confusion and the risk of errors.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="is-it-a-new-option-or-a-variation"><strong>Is It a New Option or a Variation?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Option:</strong> This approach represents a new option because it proposes a broader standardization beyond the original proposal’s intent. While the original proposal aims to unify addresses within the Polkadot ecosystem, <strong>this new option seeks to apply that unification to all Substrate-based chains, regardless of their connection to Polkadot or Kusama</strong>.</li>
</ul>

---------------------------------------------
<ol>
<li><strong>Chains Sharing the Same Prefix:</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Networks like Aleph Zero and The Root Network would indeed use the same SS58 prefix as Polkadot if they choose to adopt this standard. This means their addresses would look similar in format, starting with the same characters.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Chain Identity:</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>While unifying the address format enhances user experience, it may dilute the distinct identity of individual chains. Each chain currently uses a unique prefix partly to establish its own identity within the ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Technical Considerations:</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Runtime Updates:</strong> Chains would need to update the <code dir="auto">System.SS58Prefix</code> constant in their runtimes to match the unified prefix. This change affects how addresses are encoded and displayed.</li>
<li><strong>Client Libraries and APIs:</strong> Tools like the Polkadot API (PAPI) and wallets would need adjustments to handle the new standard without causing issues like mismatched root hashes in Merkleized metadata (RFC-0078).</li>
<li><strong>Extrinsic Validity:</strong> Care must be taken to ensure that changes do not lead to invalid transactions due to discrepancies in expected address formats.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Coordination Among Chains:</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Achieving this level of standardization would require consensus and collaboration across all Substrate-based chains. Each chain would need to agree to adopt the unified prefix and coordinate the transition to prevent user disruption.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>Adopting the <strong>same prefix across all Substrate-based chains</strong> is a more ambitious proposal that builds upon the original idea of unifying Polkadot’s address format. <strong>It aims to simplify the ecosystem further by eliminating address format fragmentation entirely</strong>. However, it introduces new challenges in terms of chain identity, technical implementation, and the need for widespread coordination. This makes it a new option that extends the original proposal’s goals to a larger context.</p>

While XCM opens up unprecedented possibilities for cross-chain collaboration, tracking these messages has been a persistent challenge.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-xcm">What is XCM?</h2>
<p><strong>XCM</strong>, or Cross-Consensus Messaging, is the communication language that enables interaction between different consensus systems. In the Polkadot ecosystem, it allows parachains, smart contracts, and other consensus systems to share messages and assets across different blockchains. XCM fosters <strong>specialization</strong> rather than generalization, allowing individual blockchains to focus on their core competencies while relying on other chains for additional services. The challenge, however, lies in monitoring these messages, as their multi-chain nature makes them inherently complex.</p>

<h3 id="the-need-for-a-simplified-tracing-process">The Need for a Simplified Tracing Process</h3>
<p>As Polkadot grows, so does the need for <strong>simplified tools</strong> to trace XCM messages. Tracking these messages requires a deep understanding of how they are composed and executed across different consensus systems, which can be both time-consuming and difficult. Until now, users had to navigate multiple interfaces, rely on fragmented data from block explorers, or subscribe to notifications across various chains.</p>
<p>This is where <strong>XCM Tracer</strong> steps in. The tool addresses these issues by offering a <strong>unified view</strong> that consolidates all the necessary data into one interface, streamlining the XCM tracking process.</p>

--------------------
<p>XCM Tracer’s <strong>workflow</strong> involves several steps, each designed to efficiently trace XCM messages as they traverse across chains. Here’s a breakdown of how the tool functions:</p>
<h3 id="1-input-and-fetch-extrinsic">1. Input and Fetch Extrinsic</h3>
<p>The first step involves the user providing the <strong>transaction hash (TX Hash)</strong> and the <strong>originating chain</strong>. XCM Tracer then queries the appropriate API endpoint from a list of supported chains. This API request returns the relevant details about the extrinsic (transaction) in question.</p>
<h3 id="2-extracting-key-details">2. Extracting Key Details</h3>
<p>Once the extrinsic information is retrieved, XCM Tracer extracts the key details, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Message ID</strong></li>
<li><strong>Block hash</strong></li>
<li><strong>Sender details</strong></li>
<li><strong>Extrinsic parameters</strong></li>
<li><strong>Events on the origin chain</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>These details form the basis for the subsequent tracking process.</p>
<h3 id="3-locating-the-destination-chain-block">3. Locating the Destination Chain Block</h3>
<p>XCM Tracer leverages Polkadot’s <strong>multi-chain architecture</strong> to track which block on the destination chain corresponds to the message’s submission from the origin chain. To achieve this, it queries the relay chain using the <strong>block hash</strong> from the origin chain.</p>
<h3 id="4-tracing-parainclusion-events">4. Tracing ParaInclusion Events</h3>
<p>Next, the tool locates the relevant <strong>ParaInclusion events</strong> on the relay chain to identify the block produced at the time the message was sent. This step ensures that XCM Tracer can pinpoint the correct block on the destination chain where the message is processed.</p>
<h3 id="5-messagequeueprocessed-event">5. MessageQueue.Processed Event</h3>
<p>Finally, the tool searches the destination chain for the <strong>MessageQueue.Processed event</strong>. If the event is found, it confirms that the message has been successfully processed. If not, XCM Tracer iterates through subsequent blocks until it finds the event, ensuring that no message is left untracked.</p>
