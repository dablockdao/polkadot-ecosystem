[**Polimec (PLMC)** ](https://dablock.com/dapps/polimec/)is a highly anticipated parachain within the Polkadot ecosystem, designed to enable decentralized and legally compliant project financing. The parachain, which collaborates closely with industry giants like Deloitte and the[ **KILT Protocol**](https://dablock.com/dapps/kilt-protocol/), ensures that projects adhere to rigorous regulatory standards. This partnership allows Polimec to issue credentials that offer security and regulatory compliance akin to that of traditional financial institutions, making it a significant player in decentralized finance.

The Polimec (PLMC) Airdrop: What You Need to Know
-------------------------------------------------

The current airdrop for the PLMC token is a crucial event for participants within the [**Polkadot ecosystem**](https://dablock.com/ecosystem/). Unlike [previous airdrops such as those for the VARCH token](https://dablock.com/news/polkadot-invarch-network-airdrop-varch/) (associated with the [**InvArch parachain**](https://dablock.com/dapps/invarch-network/)), the PMLC airdrop requires participants to possess specific credentials issued by Deloitte. These credentials are essential for engaging in the airdrop and subsequent participation in investment rounds on the [Polimec platform](https://dablock.com/dapps/polimec/).

Requirements for Participation in the Polimec Airdrop
-----------------------------------------------------

To qualify for the PLMC airdrop, users must possess a **wallet with a verified Deloitte credential**. This credential can be obtained by connecting a wallet, such as the Sporran Wallet or the Deloitte-specific wallet, to the Deloitte platform. After securing the credential, participants can proceed to the Polimec website, where they can claim their PMLC tokens.

The process is straightforward:

1. **Visit the Polimec Airdrop Website**: Navigate to the official Polimec airdrop page ([get.polimec.org](https://get.polimec.org/)).
2. **Connect Your Wallet**: Ensure that your wallet, which holds the Deloitte credential, is connected.
3. **Claim Your Tokens**: Follow the prompts to claim your PMLC tokens. As of now, 800 PMLC tokens are available per user, though the amount has decreased from the initial 1,000 PMLC tokens and may reduce further in subsequent rounds.

Polimec Token Lockup and Investment Opportunities
-------------------------------------------------

It’s important to note that the **claimed PMLC tokens will be locked for a period of 24 months**. However, these tokens can still be utilized for participating in investment rounds on the Polimec platform. This mechanism allows users to invest in and evaluate various projects within the Polimec ecosystem.

For example, one such project is Impact Scope, a blockchain initiative aimed at measuring the impact of various campaigns. Participants can use their PLMC tokens to evaluate and potentially invest in these projects, following a structured due diligence process that includes reviewing the project’s whitepaper, financial plans, and community feedback.

Steps for Participating in an Investment Round in the Polimec App
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Once PMLC tokens are claimed and locked, **users can participate in Polimec’s investment rounds**. The steps are as follows:

1. **Access the Polimec Platform**: Log into the Polimec application using your connected wallet.
2. **Select a Project**: Browse through the available projects and choose one to evaluate.
3. **Submit Credentials and Evaluate**: Provide your credentials to access detailed project information. After reviewing the details, decide on the number of PMLC tokens to commit.
4. **Complete the Transaction**: Sign the transaction with your wallet. The transaction will incur a minimal fee, and your evaluation will be recorded on-chain.

#### Cost and Future Implications

While the current process for obtaining credentials is subsidized, it’s expected that in the future, acquiring these credentials will come with a fee, potentially around $50. This fee structure underscores the professional level of service provided by Deloitte and the regulatory compliance guaranteed through their partnership.
