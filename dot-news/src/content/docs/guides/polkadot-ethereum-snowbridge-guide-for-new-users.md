Polkadot, a multi-chain network that enables interoperability between various blockchains, has introduced **Snowbridge**, a groundbreaking decentralized bridge connecting the Polkadot ecosystem to Ethereum. Snowbridge represents a significant milestone in blockchain technology, offering a trustless, general-purpose solution for transferring assets and messages between these two ecosystems.

This user guide provides a detailed overview of Snowbridge’s features, functionality, and how users can interact with the platform.

What is Polkadot Snowbridge?
----------------------------

Snowbridge is a decentralized **bridge designed to facilitate the seamless transfer of assets and messages between Polkadot and Ethereum**. Unlike traditional bridges that often rely on centralized entities or multisignature wallets, Snowbridge is fully decentralized, **leveraging light client technology to ensure trustless and secure cross-chain communication**.

Snowbridge’s architecture allows it to support not only token transfers but also the transfer of other assets, such as **non-fungible tokens (NFTs)** and arbitrary state across chains. This general-purpose functionality makes Snowbridge a versatile tool for developers and users within the Web3 ecosystem.

Snowbridge Key Features
-----------------------

1. **Trustlessness**: Snowbridge operates without requiring trust in any centralized participants or entities. Users can rely on the underlying cryptographic protocols, mathematics, and code to protect their assets and ensure the system functions as expected. This trustless nature is achieved through the use of light clients, which validate blockchain transactions independently.
2. **General-Purpose Interoperability**: While many bridges focus solely on token transfers, Snowbridge goes beyond this by supporting the transfer of various assets and messages across chains. This includes NFTs, loan contracts, and other complex assets, making Snowbridge a highly adaptable solution for different use cases.
3. **Guaranteed Deliverability and Delivery**: Snowbridge ensures that messages can be delivered trustlessly across the bridge, known as Guaranteed Deliverability. This means that any user willing to run the necessary software and pay the required gas fees can relay a message themselves without relying on third parties. Additionally, Snowbridge provides Guaranteed Delivery, where economic incentives or requirements ensure that third parties will relay messages, even if the sender does not do so.

How to Use Snowbridge and Bridge Tokens Between Ethereum and Polkadot
---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. **Accessing the Snowbridge Interface**: Users can access Snowbridge through a user-friendly interface available on supported wallets like ***Talisman*** and ***Nova Wallet***. While the bridge is in its early stages, it is recommended to avoid transferring large amounts until all testing phases are complete.
2. **Connecting Your Wallet**: To begin using Snowbridge, users must connect their Ethereum and Polkadot wallets. This can be done through the Snowbridge interface, where users will be prompted to link their wallets securely.
3. **Transferring Assets**: Snowbridge currently supports the transfer of several **ERC-20 tokens**, including ***WETH, TON, PEPE, SHIBA, WBTC***… Users can initiate transfers by selecting the desired tokens, specifying the destination chain, and confirming the transaction. The estimated transfer times are approximately **13 minutes and 24 seconds from Ethereum to Polkadot** and **2 hours and 43 minutes in the reverse direction**.
4. **Monitoring Transfer Status**: The Snowbridge interface provides real-time updates on the status of transfers. Users can view the estimated time for completion and track the progress of their transactions. Additionally, a transaction history feature allows users to review past transfers.
5. **Advanced Features**: Snowbridge is designed to support advanced functionalities such as atomic swaps, which enable users to exchange assets across chains instantaneously and with minimal costs. These features are currently being integrated and will offer significant advantages for cross-chain transactions.
6. **Future Developments**: As Snowbridge evolves, more tokens and assets will be supported, and additional features like NFT transfers and enhanced wallet support will be introduced. Collaborations with major Polkadot parachains, such as ***Moonbeam*** and ***Hydration*** (former HydraDX), will further expand the bridge’s capabilities.
