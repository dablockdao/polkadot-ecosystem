1. StellaSwap
-------------

 
**StellaSwap** is the first cross-chain decentralized exchange (DEX) built on Moonbeam. This platform has quickly gained popularity due to its comprehensive DeFi services, which include yield farming, staking, token swapping, and liquidity provisioning. By leveraging Polkadot’s cross-chain capabilities, StellaSwap enables seamless asset exchanges between different chains, addressing the limitations of isolated DeFi ecosystems.

The platform prioritizes high liquidity pools, ensuring efficient trades with minimal slippage. StellaSwap’s native token, STELLA, is integral to the platform’s ecosystem, offering governance rights, transaction fee discounts, and staking rewards. With a user-friendly interface and a focus on both new and experienced users, StellaSwap is poised to become a leading hub for DeFi activities on Moonbeam.

4. Zenlink
----------

 
**Zenlink** is a decentralized cross-chain liquidity protocol designed to enhance interoperability across different blockchains, both within and outside the Polkadot ecosystem. By enabling seamless asset swaps and liquidity provision across multiple chains, Zenlink addresses the issue of isolated liquidity pools, improving swap rates and reducing slippage for users.

Zenlink’s DEX aggregator further enhances the user experience by aggregating liquidity from various decentralized exchanges across Polkadot parachains. This ensures that users receive the best trading rates without the need to compare multiple platforms manually. The ZLK token, native to Zenlink, is used for governance and incentivizes user participation, making Zenlink a key player in creating a more interconnected and efficient DeFi ecosystem.

5. Solarflare
-------------

 
**Solarbeam** operates as a decentralized finance platform on both the Moonriver and Moonbeam networks, serving as an automated market maker (AMM) similar to Uniswap but within the Polkadot framework. Solarbeam facilitates decentralized trading, liquidity provision, and yield farming without traditional financial intermediaries.

The platform’s integration into the Polkadot ecosystem allows for cross-chain interoperability, enabling the seamless movement of assets and data between Polkadot parachains and other blockchains. This integration creates a more unified DeFi landscape, where users can interact with a diverse range of assets and services without being confined to a single blockchain. Solarbeam’s native tokens, SOLAR and FLARE, play a pivotal role in the platform’s reward mechanisms and governance. For more details, visit **[Solarbeam](https://dablock.com/dapps/solarbeam/)**.
