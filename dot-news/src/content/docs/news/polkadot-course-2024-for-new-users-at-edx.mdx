**The** **Web3 Foundation’s Technical Education team is set to launch a revamped version of the introductory course on Polkadot**, scheduled to be available on the *edX* platform by **late October 2024**. This updated course aims to provide comprehensive education on Polkadot, catering specifically to active network participants with little to no programming experience, as well as developers from outside the Polkadot ecosystem seeking to understand how Polkadot functions.

**Polkadot Course 2024 Overview and Objectives**
------------------------------------------------

The revamped course will **encompass all major protocol updates that have occurred over the past two years** **within the [Polkadot ecosystem](https://dablock.com/ecosystem/)**. It is designed to provide learners with the tools and knowledge necessary to engage effectively within the Polkadot network. The curriculum covers a broad range of topics, ensuring that participants gain a well-rounded understanding of both foundational and advanced concepts.

### **Polkadot Course Target Audience and Accessibility**

This course is particularly suited for individuals actively participating in the Polkadot network who may not have extensive programming or development experience. It also serves as a **valuable resource for developers from other blockchain ecosystems** looking to familiarize themselves with Polkadot’s architecture and functionalities.

[**The course content will be freely available** ](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-programming/web3-foundation-introduction-to-polkadot?webview=false&campaign=Introduction+to+Polkadot&source=edx&product_category=course&placement_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.edx.org%2Fschool%2Fweb3x)on the Polkadot documentation portal, ensuring wide accessibility. However, for those seeking formal assessments and credentialing, the edX platform will provide these services for a nominal fee.

### **Looking Forward: Feedback and Future Developments**

The[ **Web3 Foundation**](https://dablock.com/ecosystem/web3-foundation/) has expressed openness to feedback from the community regarding the course curriculum. Suggestions for additional topics or improvements are encouraged, reflecting the Foundation’s commitment to continuously refining educational resources in response to community needs.

This initiative aligns with the broader mission of the Web3 Foundation to nurture and support the development of decentralized web technologies. By equipping participants with the knowledge to engage more effectively with Polkadot, the course aims to further decentralize internet infrastructure and empower users within the Polkadot ecosystem.
