**Kudos** is the first-of-its-kind project aiming at smoothening the **developer onboarding within the Polkadot ecosystem**, both rich in context and fast-evolving.

What stands out about Kudos is that it is built on top of the efforts like those of the [**Polkadot Blockchain Academy**](https://polkadot.network/development/blockchain-academy/) and the [**Polkadot Fellowship**](https://dablock.com/lists/10-key-aspects-of-the-polkadot-fellowship/). But the difference in this is that Kudos seems to thrive on both building a collaborative community and ongoing skill development. It is not about learning the ropes; it is about mastering them.

Simplifying Onboarding Challenges
---------------------------------

If finding a specific place for over **25,000 repositories t**o start is hard, well, consider it a needle in a haystack experience. Kudos makes that simple with a **highly user-friendly platform that enables developers to surf, search, and filter to find the issues from GitHub effectively**. The mission? Get developers matched up with projects they find interesting and where they can best put their skills to work as quickly as possible.

Empowering Collaboration and Visibility
---------------------------------------

[Kudos](https://www.morekudos.com/) brings visibility to your project and pulls in the perspective of your collaborator, organizing the team by interests and maturity. Intuitive navigation will guide contributors through the different teams as they work on issues. Features like ***“good first issues”*** are just what it says on the tin for beginners: entry points to active projects on a fast track. You can follow[ Kudos on X](https://twitter.com/KudosPortal).
