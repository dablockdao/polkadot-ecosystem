The **Polkadot ecosystem** continues to evolve with the introduction of the new *“Head Ambassador”* role, a pivotal position aimed at enhancing **business development** within the network. This new initiative has sparked considerable discussion within the Polkadot community, especially as the governance of the network becomes increasingly dynamic.

Increased Activity in Polkadot’s Governance
-------------------------------------------

In recent months, the **Polkadot governance system, known as OpenGov**, has witnessed an unprecedented surge in activity. The average number of daily proposals has climbed to four, reflecting a heightened engagement from the community. This uptick in activity has had a noticeable impact on the Polkadot Treasury, which has seen funds being allocated at a rapid pace. Consequently, there is growing advocacy for the promotion of low-budget, independent proposals, particularly those from creators who are more grassroots and indie in nature.

The Role of Polkadot Head Ambassadors
-------------------------------------

The Head Ambassador role is a new and significant addition to the Polkadot governance framework. This position is closely linked to the ongoing Fellowship program, which is transitioning from the original Ambassador program to a more organized, on-chain structure. The community now has the power to vote on who will assume the Head Ambassador role, making it a more dynamic position compared to its predecessors.

The primary function of Head Ambassadors will focus on business development, playing a crucial role in advancing the network’s interests. The selection process for these positions has already begun, with several candidates from the Polkadot community, including those from the Spanish-speaking sector, vying for the role. Notable candidates include figures like Limo and Max Rewall, who have been nominated by community members.

Community and Governance Impact
-------------------------------

The introduction of the Head Ambassador role has prompted discussions within the community regarding the qualifications and responsibilities of candidates. There is a debate on whether these ambassadors should possess technical expertise and to what extent. Furthermore, community members like Sassenberg from the “Voces Descentralizadas” (Decentralized Voices) delegation have emphasized the importance of transparency from candidates, particularly concerning their schedules and commitments.

A notable aspect of the Head Ambassador role is the compensation, set at **$10,000 per month**. This salary reflects the high expectations placed on these ambassadors, who are expected to be highly active and engaged in their duties.

Fellowship Track and Future Prospects
-------------------------------------

The Fellowship track on Subsquare has become the primary platform where community members can observe and evaluate the candidates for the Head Ambassador role. This transition is part of a broader movement towards on-chain governance, with the community playing a more active role in shaping the direction of the network.

The Web3 Foundation has also published a comprehensive review of the first cohort of the “Voces Descentralizadas” program, which provides insights into the performance and voting patterns of delegates. This report highlights the importance of active participation and alignment among delegates, with ChaosDAO emerging as one of the most active participants.

### Conclusion

The introduction of the Head Ambassador role represents a significant step forward in the evolution of Polkadot’s governance and business development strategies. As the network continues to grow, these ambassadors will play a crucial role in shaping its future, ensuring that Polkadot remains at the forefront of innovation in the blockchain space. The community will be closely watching how this new role develops and what impact it will have on the broader ecosystem.
